		"abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by cognitive dysfunction emerging from neuropathological processes impacting brain function. AD affects brain dynamics at the local level, such as changes in the balance of inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations, as well as long-range changes to the global network. Individual differences in these changes as they relate to behaviour are poorly understood. Here, we use a multi-scale neurophysiological model, “The Virtual Brain (TVB)”, based on empirical multi-modal neuroimaging data, to study how local and global dynamics correlate with individual differences in cognition. In particular, we modeled individual resting-state functional activity of 124 individuals across the behavioural spectrum from healthy aging, to amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), to AD. The model parameters required to accurately simulate empirical functional brain imaging data correlated significantly with cognition, and exceeded the predictive capacity of empirical connectomes.\n\n【摘要翻译】阿尔茨海默病（AD）以影响大脑功能的神经病理学过程中出现的认知功能障碍为标志。AD在局部水平上影响大脑动力学，例如抑制性和兴奋性神经元群体平衡的变化，以及全球网络的长期变化。人们对这些变化中与行为相关的个体差异知之甚少。在这里，我们使用了一个基于经验多模态神经成像数据的多尺度神经生理学模型“虚拟大脑（TVB）”，来研究局部和全局动力学如何与个体认知差异相关。特别是，我们对124名个体的静息状态功能活动进行了建模，这些个体的行为范围从健康衰老到遗忘性轻度认知障碍（MCI），再到AD。准确模拟经验功能脑成像数据所需的模型参数与认知显著相关，超过了经验连接体的预测能力。",

		"abstract": "Uncovering the non-trivial brain structure–function relationship is fundamentally important for revealing organizational principles of human brain. However, it is challenging to infer a reliable relationship between individual brain structure and function, e.g., the relations between individual brain structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC). Brain structure–function displays a distributed and heterogeneous pattern, that is, many functional relationships arise from non-overlapping sets of anatomical connections. This complex relation can be interwoven with widely existed individual structural and functional variations. Motivated by the advances of generative adversarial network (GAN) and graph convolutional network (GCN) in the deep learning field, in this work, we proposed a multi-GCN based GAN (MGCN-GAN) to infer individual SC based on corresponding FC by automatically learning the complex associations between individual brain structural and functional networks. The generator of MGCN-GAN is composed of multiple multi-layer GCNs which are designed to model complex indirect connections in brain network. The discriminator of MGCN-GAN is a single multi-layer GCN which aims to distinguish the predicted SC from real SC. To overcome the inherent unstable behavior of GAN, we designed a new structure-preserving (SP) loss function to guide the generator to learn the intrinsic SC patterns more effectively. Using Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset and Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset as test beds, our MGCN-GAN model can generate reliable individual SC from FC. This result implies that there may exist a common regulation between specific brain structural and functional architectures across different individuals.\n\n【摘要翻译】揭示非琐碎的大脑结构-功能关系对于揭示人类大脑的组织原理至关重要。然而，推断个体大脑结构和功能之间的可靠关系是具有挑战性的，例如，个体大脑结构连接性（SC）和功能连接性（FC）之间的关系。大脑结构-功能表现出分布和异质的模式，即许多功能关系源于不重叠的解剖连接。这种复杂的关系可以与广泛存在的个体结构和功能变化交织在一起。受生成对抗性网络（GAN）和图卷积网络（GCN）在深度学习领域的进展启发，本工作提出了一种基于多GCN的GAN（MGCN-GAN），通过自动学习个体大脑结构和功能网络之间的复杂关联，基于相应的FC推断个体SC。MGCN-GAN的生成器由多个多层GCN组成，这些GCN被设计用于模拟大脑网络中复杂的间接连接。MGCN-GAN的鉴别器是一个单层多层GCN，旨在区分预测的SC和实际的SC。为了克服GAN固有的不稳定行为，我们设计了一个新的结构保持（SP）损失函数，以引导生成器更有效地学习固有的SC模式。使用人类连接体项目（HCP）数据集和阿尔茨海默病神经成像倡议（ADNI）数据集作为试验台，我们的MGCN-GAN模型可以从FC生成可靠的个体SC。这一结果表明，不同个体的特定大脑结构和功能结构之间可能存在共同的调节。",

		"abstract": "Brain network dysfunction is increasingly recognised in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the causes of brain connectivity disruption are still poorly understood. Recently, neuroinflammation has been identified as an important factor in AD pathogenesis. Microglia participate in the construction and maintenance of healthy neuronal networks, but pro-inflammatory microglia can also damage these circuits. We hypothesised that microglial activation is independently associated with brain connectivity disruption in AD. We performed a cross-sectional multimodal imaging study and interrogated the relationship between imaging biomarkers of neuroinflammation, Aβ deposition, brain connectivity and cognition. 42 participants (12 Aβ-positive MCI, 14 Aβ-positive AD and 16 Aβ-negative healthy controls) were recruited. Participants had 11C-PBR28 and 18F-flutemetamol PET to quantify Aβ deposition and microglial activation, T1-weighted, diffusion tensor and resting-state functional MRI to assess structural network and functional network. 11C-PBR28 uptake, structural network integrity and functional network orgnisation were compared across diagnostic groups and the relationship between neuroinflammation and brain network was tested in 26 Aβ-positive patients. Increased 11C-PBR28 uptake, decreased FA, network small-worldness and local efficiency were observed in AD patients. Cortical 11C-PBR28 uptake correlated negatively with structural integrity (standardised β = −0.375, p = 0.037) and network local efficiency (standardised β = −0.468, p &lt; 0.001), independent of cortical thickness and Aβ deposition, while Aβ was not. Network structural integrity, small-worldness and local efficiency, and cortical thickness were positively associated with cognition. Our findings suggest cortical neuroinflammation coincide with structural and functional network disruption independent of Aβ and cortical atrophy. These findings link the brain connectivity change and pathological process in Alzheimer’s disease, and suggest a pathway from neuroinflammation to systemic brain dysfunction.\n\n【摘要翻译】阿尔茨海默病（AD）患者越来越多地认识到脑网络功能障碍。然而，人们对大脑连接中断的原因仍知之甚少。近年来，神经炎症已被确定为AD发病机制中的一个重要因素。小胶质细胞参与健康神经元网络的构建和维护，但促炎性小胶质细胞也会破坏这些电路。我们假设AD患者的小胶质细胞激活与大脑连接中断独立相关。我们进行了一项横断面多模式成像研究，并询问了神经炎症、aβ沉积、大脑连接和认知的成像生物标志物之间的关系。招募了42名参与者（12名Aβ阳性MCI、14名Aβ阴性AD和16名Aβ负性健康对照）。参与者使用11C-PBR28和18F-氟替莫醇PET来量化Aβ沉积和小胶质细胞激活，T1加权，扩散张量和静息态功能MRI来评估结构网络和功能网络。比较了诊断组的11C-PBR28摄取、结构网络完整性和功能网络组织，并在26名Aβ阳性患者中测试了神经炎症与脑网络之间的关系。在AD患者中观察到11C-PBR28摄取增加、FA减少、网络小世界性和局部效率降低。皮质11C-PBR28摄取与结构完整性呈负相关（标准化β = −0.375，p = 0.037）和网络局部效率（标准化β = −0.468，p 和lt； 0.001），与皮质厚度和Aβ沉积无关，而Aβ则不然。网络结构完整性、小世界性和局部效率以及皮层厚度与认知呈正相关。我们的研究结果表明，皮质神经炎症与独立于Aβ和皮质萎缩的结构和功能网络破坏相一致。这些发现将阿尔茨海默病的大脑连接变化和病理过程联系起来，并提出了从神经炎症到系统性脑功能障碍的途径。",

		"abstract": "We examined the impact of physical activity (PA) on longitudinal change in hippocampal volume in cognitively intact older adults at varying genetic risk for the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hippocampal volume was measured from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans administered at baseline and at an 18-month follow-up in 97 healthy, cognitively intact older adults. Participants were classified as High or Low PA based on a self-report questionnaire of frequency and intensity of exercise. Risk status was defined by the presence or absence of the apolipoprotein E-epsilon 4 (APOE-ε4) allele. Four subgroups were studied: Low Risk/High PA (n = 24), Low Risk/Low PA (n = 34), High Risk/High PA (n = 22), and High Risk/Low PA (n = 17). Over the 18 month follow-up interval, hippocampal volume decreased by 3% in the High Risk/Low PA group, but remained stable in the three remaining groups. No main effects or interactions between genetic risk and PA were observed in control brain regions, including the caudate, amygdala, thalamus, pre-central gyrus, caudal middle frontal gyrus, cortical white matter (WM), and total gray matter (GM). These findings suggest that PA may help to preserve hippocampal volume in individuals at increased genetic risk for AD. The protective effects of PA on hippocampal atrophy were not observed in individuals at low risk for AD. These data suggest that individuals at genetic risk for AD should be targeted for increased levels of PA as a means of reducing atrophy in a brain region critical for the formation of episodic memories.\n\n【摘要翻译】我们研究了身体活动（PA）对认知完整的老年人海马体积纵向变化的影响，这些老年人具有不同的散发型阿尔茨海默病（AD）遗传风险。97名健康、认知完整的老年人在基线和18个月的随访中通过结构磁共振成像（MRI）扫描测量海马体积。根据运动频率和强度的自我报告问卷，参与者被分为高或低PA。风险状态由载脂蛋白Eε4（APOE-ε4）等位基因的存在与否来定义。研究了四个亚组：低风险/高PA（n=24）、低风险/低PA（n=34）、高风险/高PA（n=22）和高风险/低PA（n=17）。在18个月的随访间隔中，高危/低PA组的海马体积减少了3%，但其余三组的海马容量保持稳定。在对照脑区域，包括尾状体、杏仁核、丘脑、中央前回、额中尾回、皮质白质（WM）和总灰质（GM），未观察到遗传风险与PA之间的主要影响或相互作用。这些发现表明，PA可能有助于在AD遗传风险增加的个体中保持海马体积。在AD低风险的个体中没有观察到PA对海马萎缩的保护作用。这些数据表明，有AD遗传风险的个体应针对增加PA水平，以减少对情景记忆形成至关重要的大脑区域萎缩。",

Both groups underwent standardised clinical tests and unenhanced cranial computed tomography for post hoc volumetric analysis.ResultsThe lateral and third ventricles and the anterior and lateral fissures were significantly larger in AD than in normal ageing. The volumes of the lateral ventricle and lateral fissure permitted a highly efficient differentiation between normal ageing and AD even at the mild stage of dementia, and this differentiation was improved further in the more severe stages of illness. We identified one principal component underlying brain atrophy in normal ageing and two components in AD: a ‘grey matter’ component accounting for sulcal and third ventricular enlargement, and a ‘white matter’ component for lateral ventricular enlargement. In AD, most of the volumetric measurements were significantly correlated with cognitive impairment, but in the group of non-demented elderly controls they were correlated with age.ConclusionVolumetric indices of brain atrophy permit a highly efficient differentiation between normal ageing and AD even in the mild stages of illness and this demonstrates that substantial structural brain changes have developed in the preclinical phase of illness. We suggest that there is an uncoupling between lateral ventricular enlargement and cortical brain atrophy in AD.\n\n【摘要翻译】背景我们研究了正常衰老和可能的阿尔茨海默病（AD）患者心室和脑外脑脊液空间容积的差异，并试图研究疾病严重程度对AD和衰老的形态计量学分化的影响，这两种情况下脑萎缩的主要成分，方法将40例可能患有AD的患者与40例非痴呆的老年对照组进行配对。两组患者均接受了标准化临床测试和非增强颅骨计算机断层扫描，以进行事后体积分析。结果AD患者的侧脑室和第三脑室以及前裂和侧裂明显大于正常年龄组。即使在痴呆的轻度阶段，侧脑室和侧裂的体积也能高效地区分正常衰老和AD，而在更严重的疾病阶段，这种区分得到了进一步改善。我们确定了正常衰老中大脑萎缩的一个主要成分和AD中的两个成分：脑沟和第三脑室扩大的“灰质”成分和侧脑室扩大的‘白质’成分。在AD中，大多数体积测量与认知障碍显著相关，但在非痴呆老年对照组中，它们与年龄相关。结论即使在疾病的轻度阶段，脑萎缩的体积指数也能高效地区分正常衰老和AD，这表明在疾病的临床前阶段，大脑结构发生了实质性变化。我们认为AD患者的侧脑室增大和皮质脑萎缩之间存在解耦。",

Ventricular and extraventricular CSF was quantified, and the effects of aging were studied; in both groups, the atrophy measurement was used to correct metabolic values obtained with positron emission tomography. Patients with Alzheimer dementia had higher total CSF; extraventricular, total ventricular, and third ventricular CSF volumes (49%, 37%, 99%, and 74%, respectively); and 7% lower brain volumes than the control group. The patients also showed a more marked decline in brain volumes and a greater increase in CSF volumes with advancing age than the control group. They had a 25.0% increase in corrected whole-brain metabolic rates; the control group had only a 15.8% increase. The use of this technique may provide a basis for further studies of aging and dementia, including regional volume analysis.\n\n【摘要翻译】一种新的计算机分割技术，其中磁共振（MR）成像在不受计算机断层扫描限制的情况下产生大脑和脑脊液（CSF）的精确体积测量，用于对16名健康老年对照受试者和16名阿尔茨海默痴呆患者的数字化T2加权MR图像进行回顾性分析。定量测定心室和室外CSF，并研究衰老的影响；在两组中，萎缩测量用于校正正电子发射断层扫描获得的代谢值。阿尔茨海默痴呆患者的总CSF较高；室外、室总和第三脑室CSF体积（分别为49%、37%、99%和74%）；脑容量比对照组低7%。与对照组相比，随着年龄的增长，患者的脑容量也出现了更明显的下降，CSF容量也有了更大的增加。他们的校正全脑代谢率增加了25.0%；对照组仅增加了15.8%。这项技术的使用可能为进一步研究衰老和痴呆症提供基础，包括区域体积分析。",

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.\n\n【摘要翻译】我们介绍了Adam，一种基于低阶矩自适应估计的随机目标函数一阶梯度优化算法。该方法易于实现，计算效率高，对内存的要求很低，对梯度的对角线重新缩放是不变的，并且非常适合于数据和/或参数方面较大的问题。该方法也适用于非平稳目标和具有非常嘈杂和/或稀疏梯度的问题。超参数具有直观的解释，并且通常需要很少的调整。讨论了一些与相关算法的联系，亚当就是在这些算法的基础上受到启发的。我们还分析了该算法的理论收敛性，并给出了收敛速度的遗憾界，该收敛速度与在线凸优化框架下的最佳已知结果相当。实证结果表明，Adam方法在实际应用中效果良好，与其他随机优化方法相比效果良好。最后，我们讨论了阿达麦克斯，一个基于无穷范数的亚当变体。",

		"abstract": "Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are closely associated with Tau proteins accumulation. In this study, we aimed to implement radiomics analysis to discover high-order features from pathological biomarker and improve the classification accuracy based on Tau PET images. Two cross-racial independent cohorts from the ADNI database (121 AD patients, 197 MCI patients and 211 normal control (NC) subjects) and Huashan hospital (44 AD patients, 33 MCI patients and 36 NC subjects) were enrolled. The radiomics features of Tau PET imaging of AD related brain regions were computed for classification using a support vector machine (SVM) model. The radiomics model was trained and validated in the ADNI cohort and tested in the Huashan hospital cohort. The standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) and clinical scores model were also performed to compared with radiomics analysis. Additionally, we explored the possibility of using Tau PET radiomics features as a good biomarker to make binary identification of Tau-negative MCI versus Tau-positive MCI or apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 carrier versus ApoE ε4 non-carrier. We found that the radiomics model demonstrated best classification performance in differentiating AD/MCI patients and NC in comparison to SUVR and clinical scores models, with an accuracy of 84.8 ± 4.5%, 73.1 ± 3.6% in the ANDI cohort. Moreover, the radiomics model also demonstrated greater performance in diagnosing AD than other methods in the Huashan hospital cohort, with an accuracy of 81.9 ± 6.1%. In addition, the radiomics model also showed the satisfactory classification performance in the MCI-tau subgroup experiment (72.3 ± 3.5%, 71.9 ± 3.6% and 63.7 ± 5.9%) and in the MCI-ApoE subgroup experiment (73.5 ± 4.3%, 70.1 ± 3.9% and 62.5 ± 5.4%). In conclusion, our study showed that based on Tau PET radiomics analysis has the potential to guide and facilitate clinical diagnosis, further providing evidence for identifying the risk factors in MCI patients.\n\n【摘要翻译】阿尔茨海默病（AD）和轻度认知障碍（MCI）与Tau蛋白积累密切相关。在这项研究中，我们旨在实现放射组学分析，从病理生物标志物中发现高阶特征，并提高基于Tau PET图像的分类准确性。来自ADNI数据库的两个跨种族独立队列（121名AD患者、197名MCI患者和211名正常对照（NC）受试者）和华山医院（44名AD患者，33名MCI病人和36名NC受试者。使用支持向量机（SVM）模型计算AD相关大脑区域的Tau PET成像的放射组学特征以进行分类。放射组学模型在ADNI队列中进行训练和验证，并在华山医院队列中进行测试。还进行了标准摄取值比率（SUVR）和临床评分模型，以与放射组学分析进行比较。此外，我们探索了使用Tau PET放射组学特征作为良好生物标志物的可能性，以对Tau阴性MCI与Tau阳性MCI或载脂蛋白E（ApoE）ε4载体与非载体ApoEε4进行二元鉴定。我们发现，与SUVR和临床评分模型相比，放射组学模型在区分AD/MCI患者和NC方面表现出最佳的分类性能，在ANDI队列中的准确率分别为84.8±4.5%和73.1±3.6%。此外，在华山医院队列中，放射组学模型在诊断AD方面也表现出比其他方法更高的性能，准确率为81.9±6.1%。此外，放射组学模型在MCI-tau亚组实验中（72.3±3.5%、71.9±3.6%和63.7±5.9%）和MCI-ApoE亚组实验（73.5±4.3%、70.1±3.9%和62.5±5.4%）也显示出令人满意的分类性能。总之，我们的研究表明，基于Tau PET放射组学分析有可能指导和促进临床诊断，进一步为识别MCI患者的危险因素提供证据。",

		"abstract": "Hippocampal morphological change is one of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether hippocampal radiomic features are robust as predictors of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia and whether these features provide any neurobiological foundation remains unclear. The primary aim of this study was to verify whether hippocampal radiomic features can serve as robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers for AD. Multivariate classifier-based support vector machine (SVM) analysis provided individual-level predictions for distinguishing AD patients (n = 261) from normal controls (NCs; n = 231) with an accuracy of 88.21% and intersite cross-validation. Further analyses of a large, independent the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (n = 1228) reinforced these findings. In MCI groups, a systemic analysis demonstrated that the identified features were significantly associated with clinical features (e.g., apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, polygenic risk scores, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ, CSF Tau), and longitudinal changes in cognition ability; more importantly, the radiomic features had a consistently altered pattern with changes in the MMSE scores over 5 years of follow-up. These comprehensive results suggest that hippocampal radiomic features can serve as robust biomarkers for clinical application in AD/MCI, and further provide evidence for predicting whether an MCI subject would convert to AD based on the radiomics of the hippocampus. The results of this study are expected to have a substantial impact on the early diagnosis of AD/MCI.\n\n【摘要翻译】海马形态变化是阿尔茨海默病（AD）的主要特征之一。然而，海马放射组学特征是否是从轻度认知障碍（MCI）发展为AD痴呆的有力预测因素，以及这些特征是否提供了任何神经生物学基础仍不清楚。本研究的主要目的是验证海马放射学特征是否可以作为AD的有力磁共振成像（MRI）标志物。基于多变量分类器的支持向量机（SVM）分析提供了个体水平的预测，用于区分AD患者（n=261）和正常对照组（NC；n=231），准确率为88.21%，并进行了站点间交叉验证。对阿尔茨海默病神经成像倡议（ADNI）大型独立数据集（n=1228）的进一步分析强化了这些发现。在MCI组中，系统分析表明，所识别的特征与临床特征（例如，载脂蛋白e（APOE）基因型、多基因风险评分、脑脊液（CSF）aβ、CSF Tau）和认知能力的纵向变化显著相关；更重要的是，在5年的随访中，放射学特征与MMSE评分的变化具有一致的变化模式。这些综合结果表明，海马放射组学特征可以作为AD/MCI临床应用的有力生物标志物，并进一步为基于海马放射组论预测MCI受试者是否会转化为AD提供证据。这项研究的结果有望对AD/MCI的早期诊断产生重大影响。",

Here, we document heterogeneity in regional-atrophy patterns using latent-profile analysis of 1,482 longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging observations. The results supported a 2-group solution reflecting differences in atrophy rates in cortical regions and hippocampus along with comparable caudate atrophy. The higher-atrophy group had the most marked atrophy in hippocampus and also lower episodic memory, and their normal caudate atrophy rate was accompanied by larger baseline volumes. Our findings support and refine models of heterogeneity in brain aging and suggest distinct mechanisms of atrophy in striatal versus hippocampal-cortical systems.\n\n【摘要翻译】摘要有充分的证据表明，一些大脑区域，如联想皮层、尾状体和海马体，特别容易发生与年龄相关的萎缩，但有人假设，萎缩特征存在个体差异。在这里，我们使用1482个纵向磁共振成像观察的潜在剖面分析来记录区域萎缩模式的异质性。结果支持两组解决方案，反映了皮质区域和海马体萎缩率的差异以及类似的尾状体萎缩。高萎缩组的海马萎缩最为明显，情节记忆也较低，其正常尾状体萎缩率伴有较大的基线体积。我们的发现支持并完善了大脑老化异质性的模型，并提出了纹状体和海马皮层系统萎缩的不同机制。",

		"abstract": "Objective:\nTo investigate the added value of hippocampal atrophy rates over whole brain volume measurements on MRI in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and controls.\n\nMethods:\nWe included 64 patients with AD (67 ± 9 years; F/M 38/26), 44 patients with MCI (71 ± 6 years; 21/23), and 34 controls (67 ± 9 years; 16/18). Two MR scans were performed (scan interval: 1.8 ± 0.7 years; 1.0 T), using a coronal three-dimensional T1-weighted gradient echo sequence. At follow-up, 3 controls and 23 patients with MCI had progressed to AD. Hippocampi were manually delineated at baseline. Hippocampal atrophy rates were calculated using regional, nonlinear fluid registration. Whole brain baseline volumes and atrophy rates were determined using automated segmentation and registration tools.\n\nResults:\nAll MRI measures differed between groups (p < 0.005). For the distinction of MCI from controls, larger effect sizes of hippocampal measures were found compared to whole brain measures. Between MCI and AD, only whole brain atrophy rate differed significantly. Cox proportional hazards models (variables dichotomized by median) showed that within all patients without dementia, hippocampal baseline volume (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.7 [95% confidence interval: 1.5–22.2]), hippocampal atrophy rate (5.2 [1.9–14.3]), and whole brain atrophy rate (2.8 [1.1–7.2]) independently predicted progression to AD; the combination of low hippocampal volume and high atrophy rate yielded a HR of 61.1 (6.1–606.8). Within patients with MCI, only hippocampal baseline volume and atrophy rate predicted progression.\n\nConclusion:\nHippocampal measures, especially hippocampal atrophy rate, best discriminate mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from controls. Whole brain atrophy rate discriminates Alzheimer disease (AD) from MCI. Regional measures of hippocampal atrophy are the strongest predictors of progression to AD.\n\nGLOSSARY\nnull\n\n【摘要翻译】目的：研究阿尔茨海默病（AD）患者、轻度认知障碍（MCI）患者和对照组的MRI全脑体积测量中海马萎缩率的附加值。方法：我们纳入了64例AD患者（67±9岁；F/M38/26）、44例MCI患者（71±6岁；21/23）和34例对照组（67±9%；16/18）。使用冠状三维T1加权梯度回波序列进行了两次MR扫描（扫描间隔：1.8±0.7年；1.0T）。随访时，3名对照组和23名MCI患者进展为AD。基线时手动描绘海马。海马萎缩率是使用区域性、非线性液体配准来计算的。使用自动分割和配准工具确定全脑基线体积和萎缩率。结果：各组之间的所有MRI测量结果都有差异（p＜0.005）。就MCI与对照组的区别而言，与全脑测量相比，海马测量的效果更大。在MCI和AD之间，只有全脑萎缩率有显著差异。Cox比例风险模型（变量按中位数二分）显示，在所有无痴呆的患者中，海马基线体积（风险比[HR]:5.7[95%置信区间：1.5-22.2]）、海马萎缩率（5.2[1.9-14.3]）和全脑萎缩率（2.8[1.1-7.2]）独立预测AD的进展；低海马体积和高萎缩率的组合产生了61.1（6.1–606.8）的HR。在MCI患者中，只有海马基线体积和萎缩率可以预测进展。结论：海马测量，尤其是海马萎缩率，可以最好地区分轻度认知障碍（MCI）和对照组。全脑萎缩率可区分阿尔茨海默病（AD）和MCI。海马萎缩的区域测量是进展为AD的最强预测因素",

		"abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries. From a research point of view, impressive results have been reported using computer-aided algorithms, but clinically no practical diagnostic method is available. In recent years, deep models have become popular, especially in dealing with images. Since 2013, deep learning has begun to gain considerable attention in AD detection research, with the number of published papers in this area increasing drastically since 2017. Deep models have been reported to be more accurate for AD detection compared to general machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, AD detection is still challenging, and for classification, it requires a highly discriminative feature representation to separate similar brain patterns. This paper reviews the current state of AD detection using deep learning. Through a systematic literature review of over 100 articles, we set out the most recent findings and trends. Specifically, we review useful biomarkers and features (personal information, genetic data, and brain scans), the necessary pre-processing steps, and different ways of dealing with neuroimaging data originating from single-modality and multi-modality studies. Deep models and their performance are described in detail. Although deep learning has achieved notable performance in detecting AD, there are several limitations, especially regarding the availability of datasets and training procedures.\n\n【摘要翻译】阿尔茨海默病（AD）是发达国家死亡的主要原因之一。从研究的角度来看，使用计算机辅助算法已经报告了令人印象深刻的结果，但临床上没有实用的诊断方法。近年来，深度模型变得流行起来，尤其是在处理图像方面。自2013年以来，深度学习开始在AD检测研究中获得相当大的关注，自2017年以来，该领域发表的论文数量急剧增加。据报道，与一般的机器学习技术相比，深度模型对AD检测更准确。尽管如此，AD检测仍然具有挑战性，对于分类来说，它需要高度判别的特征表示来分离相似的大脑模式。本文综述了利用深度学习进行AD检测的现状。通过对100多篇文章的系统文献综述，我们列出了最新的发现和趋势。具体而言，我们回顾了有用的生物标志物和特征（个人信息、遗传数据和大脑扫描）、必要的预处理步骤，以及处理源自单模态和多模态研究的神经成像数据的不同方法。详细描述了深度模型及其性能。尽管深度学习在检测AD方面取得了显著的性能，但仍存在一些局限性，特别是在数据集和训练程序的可用性方面。",

		"abstract": "The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stage, e.g., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is essential for timely treatment or possible intervention to slow down AD progression. Recent studies have demonstrated that multiple neuroimaging and biological measures contain complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis. Therefore, information fusion strategies with multi-modal neuroimaging data, such as voxel-based measures extracted from structural MRI (VBM-MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), have shown their effectiveness for AD diagnosis. However, most existing methods are proposed to simply integrate the multi-modal data, but do not make full use of structure information across the different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal neuroimaging feature selection method with consistent metric constraint (MFCC) for AD analysis. First, the similarity is calculated for each modality (i.e. VBM-MRI or FDG-PET) individually by random forest strategy, which can extract pairwise similarity measures for multiple modalities. Then the group sparsity regularization term and the sample similarity constraint regularization term are used to constrain the objective function to conduct feature selection from multiple modalities. Finally, the multi-kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) is used to fuse the features selected from different models for final classification. The experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) show that the proposed method has better classification performance than the start-of-the-art multimodality-based methods. Specifically, we achieved higher accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) for AD versus normal controls (NC), MCI versus NC, and MCI converters (MCI-C) versus MCI non-converters (MCI-NC) on ADNI datasets. Therefore, the proposed model not only outperforms the traditional method in terms of AD/MCI classification, but also discovers the characteristics associated with the disease, demonstrating its promise for improving disease-related mechanistic understanding.\n\n【摘要翻译】准确诊断阿尔茨海默病（AD）及其早期阶段，例如轻度认知障碍（MCI），对于及时治疗或可能的干预以减缓AD进展至关重要。最近的研究表明，多种神经影像学和生物学指标包含诊断和预后的互补信息。因此，多模态神经成像数据的信息融合策略，如从结构MRI（VBM-MRI）和氟脱氧葡萄糖正电子发射断层扫描（FDG-PET）中提取的基于体素的测量，已显示出其对AD诊断的有效性。然而，大多数现有的方法都是简单地集成多模态数据，但没有充分利用不同模态的结构信息。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的具有一致度量约束的多模态神经成像特征选择方法（MFCC），用于AD分析。首先，通过随机森林策略单独计算每个模态（即VBM-MRI或FDG-PET）的相似性，该策略可以提取多个模态的成对相似性度量。然后使用群稀疏性正则化项和样本相似性约束正则化项来约束目标函数从多个模态中进行特征选择。最后，使用多核支持向量机（MK-SVM）融合从不同模型中选择的特征进行最终分类。阿尔茨海默病神经成像倡议（ADNI）的实验结果表明，所提出的方法比最早的基于多模态的方法具有更好的分类性能。具体而言，我们在ADNI数据集上实现了AD与正常对照（NC）、MCI与NC以及MCI转换器（MCI-C）与MCI非转换器（MCI-NC）的更高精度和曲线下面积（AUC）。因此，所提出的模型不仅在AD/MCI分类方面优于传统方法，而且发现了与疾病相关的特征，证明了其在提高疾病相关机制理解方面的前景。",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo use structural magnetic resonance (MR) images to identify a pattern of regional atrophy characteristic of mild Alzheimer disease (AD) and to investigate whether presence of this pattern prospectively can aid prediction of 1-year clinical decline and increased structural loss in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe study was conducted with institutional review board approval and compliance with HIPAA regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. High-throughput volumetric segmentation and cortical surface reconstruction methods were applied to MR images from 84 subjects with mild AD, 175 with MCI, and 139 healthy control (HC) subjects. Stepwise linear discriminant analysis was used to identify regions that best can aid discrimination of HC subjects from subjects with AD. A classifier trained on data from HC subjects and those with AD was applied to data from subjects with MCI to determine whether presence of phenotypic AD atrophy at baseline was predictive of clinical decline and structural loss.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAtrophy in mesial and lateral temporal, isthmus cingulate, and orbitofrontal areas aided discrimination of HC subjects from subjects with AD, with fully cross-validated sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 93%. Subjects with MCI who had phenotypic AD atrophy showed significantly greater 1-year clinical decline and structural loss than those who did not and were more likely to have progression to probable AD (annual progression rate of 29% for subjects with MCI who had AD atrophy vs 8% for those who did not).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSemiautomated, individually specific quantitative MR imaging methods can be used to identify a pattern of regional atrophy in MCI that is predictive of clinical decline. Such information may aid in prediction of patient prognosis and increase the efficiency of clinical trials.\n\n【摘要翻译】目的使用结构磁共振（MR）图像来识别轻度阿尔茨海默病（AD）特有的区域性萎缩模式，并研究这种模式的存在是否有助于预测轻度认知障碍（MCI）1年的临床下降和结构损失增加。材料和方法本研究经机构审查委员会批准并符合HIPAA法规。获得每位参与者的书面知情同意书。将高通量体积分割和皮层表面重建方法应用于84名轻度AD受试者、175名MCI受试者和139名健康对照（HC）受试者的MR图像。使用逐步线性判别分析来确定最有助于区分HC受试者和AD受试者的区域。将基于HC受试人和AD受检者数据训练的分类器应用于MCI受试者数据，以确定基线时表型AD萎缩的存在是否能预测临床下降和结构损失。结果颞内侧和外侧、扣带峡部和眶额区的萎缩有助于区分HC受试者和AD受试者，完全交叉验证的敏感性为83%，特异性为93%。患有表型AD萎缩的MCI受试者的1年临床下降和结构损失明显大于未患有表型AD的受试者，并且更有可能发展为可能的AD（患有AD萎缩的MCA受试者年进展率为29%，而没有患有表型AD萎缩症的MCA被试者为8%）。结论半自动、个体特异性的定量MR成像方法可用于识别MCI区域萎缩的模式，该模式可预测临床衰退。这样的信息可以有助于预测患者预后并提高临床试验的效率。",

		"abstract": "Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.\n\n【摘要翻译】尽管被广泛采用，机器学习模型仍然大多是黑匣子。然而，了解预测背后的原因在评估信任方面非常重要，如果一个人计划根据预测采取行动，或者在选择是否部署新模型时，信任是至关重要的。这种理解也提供了对模型的见解，可以用来将不可信的模型或预测转化为可信的模型。在这项工作中，我们提出了LIME，这是一种新的解释技术，通过在预测周围局部学习可解释模型，以可解释和忠实的方式解释任何分类器的预测。我们还提出了一种解释模型的方法，通过以非冗余的方式呈现具有代表性的个体预测及其解释，将任务定义为子模块优化问题。我们通过解释文本（例如随机森林）和图像分类（例如神经网络）的不同模型来证明这些方法的灵活性。我们通过模拟和人类受试者的新实验，在各种需要信任的场景中展示了解释的效用：决定是否应该信任预测，在模型之间进行选择，改进不可信的分类器，以及确定为什么不应该信任分类器。",

		"abstract": "Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.\n\n【摘要翻译】在许多应用中，理解一个模型为什么会做出某种预测与预测的准确性一样至关重要。然而，大型现代数据集的最高精度通常是通过复杂的模型来实现的，即使是专家也很难解释这些模型，例如集成或深度学习模型，这在准确性和可解释性之间产生了紧张关系。作为回应，最近提出了各种方法来帮助用户解释复杂模型的预测，但通常不清楚这些方法是如何相关的，以及何时一种方法优于另一种方法。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个统一的预测解释框架，SHAP（SHapley Additive exPlanations）。SHAP为每个特征分配一个特定预测的重要性值。它的新组成部分包括：（1）一类新的加性特征重要性测度的识别，以及（2）理论结果表明，在这类测度中存在一个具有一组理想性质的唯一解。新类统一了六个现有方法，值得注意的是，该类中最近的几个方法缺乏所提出的理想属性。基于这种统一的见解，我们提出了新的方法，这些方法比以前的方法显示出更好的计算性能和/或更好的与人类直觉的一致性。",

The method utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for classification with several feature extraction techniques. MRI is a non-invasive procedure, widely adopted in hospitals to examine cognitive abnormalities. Images are acquired using the T2 imaging sequence. The paradigm consists of a series of quantitative techniques: filtering, feature extraction, Student’s t-test based feature selection, and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) based classification. Additionally, a comparative analysis is done by implementing other feature extraction procedures that are described in the literature. Our findings suggest that the Shearlet Transform (ST) feature extraction technique offers improved results for Alzheimer’s diagnosis as compared to alternative methods. The proposed CABD tool with the ST + KNN technique provided accuracy of 94.54%, precision of 88.33%, sensitivity of 96.30% and specificity of 93.64%. Furthermore, this tool also offered an accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity of 98.48%, 100%, 96.97% and 100%, respectively, with the benchmark MRI database.\n\n【摘要翻译】这项工作的目的是开发一种计算机辅助大脑诊断（CABD）系统，该系统可以确定大脑扫描是否显示出阿尔茨海默病的迹象。该方法利用磁共振成像（MRI）与几种特征提取技术进行分类。核磁共振成像是一种非侵入性手术，广泛应用于医院检查认知异常。使用T2成像序列来获取图像。该范式由一系列定量技术组成：滤波、特征提取、基于Student t检验的特征选择和基于k近邻（KNN）的分类。此外，通过实施文献中描述的其他特征提取程序来进行比较分析。我们的研究结果表明，与其他方法相比，Shearet变换（ST）特征提取技术为阿尔茨海默氏症的诊断提供了更好的结果。建议的带有ST的CABD工具 <<T> > KNN技术的准确率为94.54%，精密度为88.33%，灵敏度为96.30%，特异性为93.64%。此外，与基准MRI数据库相比，该工具的准确度、精密度、灵敏度和特异性分别为98.48%、100%、96.97%和100%。",

		"abstract": "Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liuzhuang13/DenseNet .\n\n【摘要翻译】最近的工作表明，如果卷积网络在靠近输入的层和靠近输出的层之间包含较短的连接，那么卷积网络可以进行更深入、更准确和高效的训练。在本文中，我们接受了这一观察结果，并介绍了密集卷积网络（DenseNet），它以前馈的方式将每一层连接到另一层。具有L层的传统卷积网络具有L个连接——每层及其后续层之间有一个连接——而我们的网络具有L（L+1）/2个直接连接。对于每个层，所有先前层的特征图都用作输入，其自身的特征图也用作所有后续层的输入。DenseNet有几个引人注目的优势：它们缓解了消失梯度问题，加强了特征传播，鼓励了特征重用，并大大减少了参数的数量。我们在四个竞争激烈的对象识别基准任务（CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、SVHN和ImageNet）上评估了我们提出的架构。DenseNet在大多数方面都比最先进的技术有了显著的改进，同时需要更少的计算才能实现高性能。代码和预先训练的模型可在https://github.com/liuzhuang13/DenseNet。",

		"abstract": "Deep learning based inverse scattering (DL-IS) methods attract much attention in recent years due to advantages of fast speed and high-quality reconstruction. The loss functions of neural networks in DL-IS methods are commonly based on a pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) between the reconstructed image and its reference one. In this article, we introduce a structural similarity (SSIM) loss function to combine with the MSE loss for reconstructing dielectric targets under a DL-IS framework. The SSIM loss imposes a further regularization on the target at the perceptual level. Numerical tests for both synthetic and experimental data verify that this new perceptually-inspired loss function can effectively improve the imaging quality and the generalization capability of the trained model.\n\n【摘要翻译】基于深度学习的逆散射（DL-IS）方法由于其快速、高质量的重建优点，近年来备受关注。DL-IS方法中神经网络的损失函数通常基于重建图像与其参考图像之间的逐像素均方误差（MSE）。在本文中，我们引入了一种结构相似性（SSIM）损失函数，将其与MSE损失相结合，用于在DL-IS框架下重建介电目标。SSIM损失在感知水平上对目标施加了进一步的正则化。对合成和实验数据的数值测试验证了这种新的感知启发损失函数可以有效地提高训练模型的成像质量和泛化能力。",

		"abstract": "Quality is a very important parameter for all objects and their functionalities. In image-based object recognition, image quality is a prime criterion. For authentic image quality evaluation, ground truth is required. But in practice, it is very difficult to find the ground truth. Usually, image quality is being assessed by full reference metrics, like MSE (Mean Square Error) and PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio). In contrast to MSE and PSNR, recently, two more full reference metrics SSIM (Structured Similarity Indexing Method) and FSIM (Feature Similarity Indexing Method) are developed with a view to compare the structural and feature similarity measures between restored and original objects on the basis of perception. This paper is mainly stressed on comparing different image quality metrics to give a comprehensive view. Experimentation with these metrics using benchmark images is performed through denoising for different noise concentrations. All metrics have given consistent results. However, from representation perspective, SSIM and FSIM are normalized, but MSE and PSNR are not; and from semantic perspective, MSE and PSNR are giving only absolute error; on the other hand, SSIM and PSNR are giving perception and saliency-based error. So, SSIM and FSIM can be treated more understandable than the MSE and PSNR.\n\n【摘要翻译】质量是所有对象及其功能的一个非常重要的参数。在基于图像的目标识别中，图像质量是一个主要标准。对于真实的图像质量评估，需要地面实况。但在实践中，很难找到基本的真相。通常，图像质量是通过全参考度量来评估的，如MSE（均方误差）和PSNR（峰值信噪比）。与MSE和PSNR相比，最近又开发了两种完全参考度量SSIM（结构化相似性索引方法）和FSIM（特征相似性索引法），以期在感知的基础上比较恢复对象和原始对象之间的结构和特征相似性度量。本文主要侧重于比较不同的图像质量指标，以给出一个全面的观点。通过对不同噪声浓度进行去噪，使用基准图像对这些度量进行实验。所有指标都给出了一致的结果。然而，从表示的角度来看，SSIM和FSIM是归一化的，而MSE和PSNR不是；从语义角度来看，MSE和PSNR只给出了绝对误差；另一方面，SSIM和PSNR给出了基于感知和显著性的误差。因此，SSIM和FSIM可以比MSE和PSNR更容易理解。",

Although many techniques have been developed for imputing missing data, the image imputation is still difficult due to complicated nature of natural images. To address this problem, here we proposed a novel framework for missing image data imputation, called Collaborative Generative Adversarial Network (CollaGAN). CollaGAN convert the image imputation problem to a multi-domain images-to-image translation task so that a single generator and discriminator network can successfully estimate the missing data using the remaining clean data set.

Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as a classiﬁer with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, we found that this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process. To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the least squares loss function for the discriminator. We show that minimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson χ2 divergence. There are two beneﬁts of LSGANs over regular GANs. First, LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs. Second, LSGANs perform more stable during the learning process. We evaluate LSGANs on LSUN and CIFAR-10 datasets and the experimental results show that the images generated by LSGANs are of better quality than the ones generated by regular GANs.

		"abstract": "Synthesizing medical images, such as PET, is a challenging task due to the fact that the intensity range is much wider and denser than those in photographs and digital renderings and are often heavily biased toward zero. Above all, intensity values in PET have absolute significance, and are used to compute parameters that are reproducible across the population. Yet, usually much manual adjustment has to be made in pre-/post- processing when synthesizing PET images, because its intensity ranges can vary a lot, e.g., between -100 to 1000 in floating point values. To overcome these challenges, we adopt the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) algorithm that has had great success in natural language processing (NLP), where wide-range floating point intensity values are represented as integers ranging between 0 to 10000 that resemble a dictionary of natural language vocabularies. BERT is then trained to predict a proportion of masked values images, where its \"next sentence prediction (NSP)\" acts as GAN discriminator. Our proposed approach, is able to generate PET images from MRI images in wide intensity range, with no manual adjustments in pre-/post- processing. It is a method that can scale and ready to deploy.\n\n【摘要翻译】合成医学图像（如PET）是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为其强度范围比照片和数字渲染中的强度范围宽得多、密度大得多，而且往往严重偏向于零。最重要的是，PET中的强度值具有绝对意义，并用于计算在整个群体中可重复的参数。然而，合成PET图像时，通常必须在前/后处理中进行大量手动调整，因为其强度范围可能变化很大，例如浮点值在-100到1000之间。为了克服这些挑战，我们采用了来自变压器的双向编码器表示（BERT）算法，该算法在自然语言处理（NLP）中取得了巨大成功，其中宽范围的浮点强度值表示为0到10000之间的整数，类似于自然语言词汇表的字典。然后训练BERT来预测一定比例的掩蔽值图像，其中其“下一句预测（NSP）”充当GAN鉴别器。我们提出的方法能够在宽强度范围内从MRI图像生成PET图像，而无需在前/后处理中进行手动调整。这是一种可以扩展并随时可以部署的方法。",

However, there are some common concerns in PET scans including the high cost, the usage of radioactive tracer and so on. These factors jointly result in a lack of PET datas. To overcome this limitation, in this study we proposed an effective U-Net architecture with the adversarial training strategy to synthesizing PET datas from their corresponding MRI. In addition, we notice that many prior works commonly adopted Batch Normalization (BN) as the normalization method by default. But in this specific task which always needs a small mini-batch, BN's performance decreases rapidly. To alleviate this issue, we compared the performance of using other popular normalization methods rather than using BN as default. Experimental results on a subset of ADNI database demonstrated that the synthetic PET images from our proposed method were reasonable, and it was valuable to replace the Batch Normalization with the Instance Normalization in the tasks of cross-modality synthesis.

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

		"abstract": "Registration is an important component of medical image analysis and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have fully automatic registration methods. Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage.\n\n【摘要翻译】配准是医学图像分析的重要组成部分，并且为了分析大量数据，希望具有全自动配准方法。迄今为止，已经提出了许多不同的自动注册方法，几乎所有方法都有一个共同的数学框架——优化成本函数。迄今为止，很少有人关注优化方法本身，尽管大多数注册方法的成功取决于这种优化的质量。本文研究了使用模态间体素相似性测量的大脑图像配准问题的基本假设。结果表明，局部优化方法与标准多分辨率方法的结合不足以可靠地找到全局最小值。为了解决这个问题，提出了一种专门针对这种注册形式定制的全局优化方法。由于这是任何实际方法的重要组成部分，因此包含了对所有必要实现细节的充分讨论。此外，给出了模态间、受试者间配准实验的结果，表明所提出的方法在寻找全局最小值方面比目前常用的几种配准包更可靠。",

		"abstract": "The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a longitudinal multisite observational study of healthy elders, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET), urine serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, as well as clinical/psychometric assessments are acquired at multiple time points. All data will be cross-linked and made available to the general scientific community. The purpose of this report is to describe the MRI methods employed in ADNI. The ADNI MRI core established specifications that guided protocol development. A major effort was devoted to evaluating 3D T(1)-weighted sequences for morphometric analyses. Several options for this sequence were optimized for the relevant manufacturer platforms and then compared in a reduced-scale clinical trial. The protocol selected for the ADNI study includes: back-to-back 3D magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) scans; B(1)-calibration scans when applicable; and an axial proton density-T(2) dual contrast (i.e., echo) fast spin echo/turbo spin echo (FSE/TSE) for pathology detection. ADNI MRI methods seek to maximize scientific utility while minimizing the burden placed on participants. The approach taken in ADNI to standardization across sites and platforms of the MRI protocol, postacquisition corrections, and phantom-based monitoring of all scanners could be used as a model for other multisite trials.\n\n【摘要翻译】阿尔茨海默病神经成像倡议（ADNI）是一项针对健康老年人、轻度认知障碍（MCI）和阿尔茨海默病的纵向多站点观察性研究。在多个时间点采集磁共振成像（MRI）、（18F）-氟脱氧葡萄糖正电子发射断层扫描（FDG PET）、尿血清和脑脊液（CSF）生物标志物以及临床/心理测量评估。所有数据都将进行交叉链接，并提供给一般科学界。本报告的目的是描述ADNI中使用的MRI方法。ADNI MRI核心制定了指导协议开发的规范。主要致力于评估用于形态计量分析的3D T（1）加权序列。该序列的几个选项针对相关制造商平台进行了优化，然后在缩小规模的临床试验中进行了比较。为ADNI研究选择的方案包括：背靠背3D磁化制备快速梯度回波（MP-RAGE）扫描；B（1）-适用时的校准扫描；以及用于病理学检测的轴向质子密度-T（2）双对比度（即回波）快速自旋回波/涡轮自旋回波（FSE/TSE）。ADNI MRI方法寻求最大限度地提高科学实用性，同时最大限度地减少参与者的负担。ADNI中采用的MRI协议、采集后校正和所有扫描仪基于体模的监测的跨站点和平台标准化方法可作为其他多站点试验的模型。",

In this work, we aim to model a distribution of possible outputs in a conditional generative modeling setting. The ambiguity of the mapping is distilled in a low-dimensional latent vector, which can be randomly sampled at test time. A generator learns to map the given input, combined with this latent code, to the output. We explicitly encourage the connection between output and the latent code to be invertible. This helps prevent a many-to-one mapping from the latent code to the output during training, also known as the problem of mode collapse, and produces more diverse results. We explore several variants of this approach by employing different training objectives, network architectures, and methods of injecting the latent code. Our proposed method encourages bijective consistency between the latent encoding and output modes. We present a systematic comparison of our method and other variants on both perceptual realism and diversity.\n\n【摘要翻译】许多图像到图像的翻译问题是模糊的，因为单个输入图像可能对应于多个可能的输出。在这项工作中，我们的目标是在条件生成建模环境中对可能输出的分布进行建模。映射的模糊性是在低维潜在向量中提取的，该向量可以在测试时随机采样。生成器学习将给定的输入与该潜在代码相结合映射到输出。我们明确鼓励输出和潜在代码之间的连接是可逆的。这有助于防止在训练期间从潜在代码到输出的多对一映射，也称为模式崩溃问题，并产生更多样的结果。我们通过采用不同的训练目标、网络架构和注入潜在代码的方法来探索这种方法的几种变体。我们提出的方法鼓励潜在编码和输出模式之间的双射一致性。我们对我们的方法和其他变体在感知现实主义和多样性方面进行了系统的比较。",

		"abstract": "Many machine learning and pattern classiﬁcation methods have been applied to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Recently, rather than predicting categorical variables as in classiﬁcation, several pattern regression methods have also been used to estimate continuous clinical variables from brain images. However, most existing regression methods focus on estimating multiple clinical variables separately and thus cannot utilize the intrinsic useful correlation information among different clinical variables. On the other hand, in those regression methods, only a single modality of data (usually only the structural MRI) is often used, without considering the complementary information that can be provided by different modalities. In this paper, we propose a general methodology, namely multimodal multi-task (M3T) learning, to jointly predict multiple variables from multi-modal data. Here, the variables include not only the clinical variables used for regression but also the categorical variable used for classiﬁcation, with different tasks corresponding to prediction of different variables. Speciﬁcally, our method contains two key components, i.e., (1) a multi-task feature selection which selects the common subset of relevant features for multiple variables from each modality, and (2) a multi-modal support vector machine which fuses the above-selected features from all modalities to predict multiple (regression and classiﬁcation) variables. To validate our method, we perform two sets of experiments on ADNI baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) data from 45 AD patients, 91 MCI patients, and 50 healthy controls (HC). In the ﬁrst set of experiments, we estimate two clinical variables such as Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), as well as one categorical variable (with value of ‘AD’, ‘MCI’ or ‘HC’), from the baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data. In the second set of experiments, we predict the 2-year changes of MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores and also the conversion of MCI to AD from the baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data. The results on both sets of experiments demonstrate that our proposed M3T learning scheme can achieve better performance on both regression and classiﬁcation tasks than the conventional learning methods.\n\n【摘要翻译】许多机器学习和模式分类方法已被应用于阿尔茨海默病（AD）及其前驱阶段，即轻度认知障碍（MCI）的诊断。最近，几种模式回归方法也被用于从大脑图像中估计连续的临床变量，而不是像分类中那样预测分类变量。然而，大多数现有的回归方法侧重于单独估计多个临床变量，因此无法利用不同临床变量之间固有的有用相关性信息。另一方面，在这些回归方法中，通常只使用单一的数据模式（通常只使用结构MRI），而不考虑不同模式可以提供的补充信息。在本文中，我们提出了一种通用的方法，即多模态多任务（M3T）学习，以从多模态数据中联合预测多个变量。这里，变量不仅包括用于回归的临床变量，还包括用于分类的分类变量，不同的任务对应于不同变量的预测。具体而言，我们的方法包含两个关键组成部分，即（1）多任务特征选择，它为每个模态中的多个变量选择相关特征的公共子集；（2）多模态支持向量机，它融合了所有模态中的上述选择特征，以预测多个（回归和分类）变量。为了验证我们的方法，我们对45名AD患者、91名MCI患者和50名健康对照（HC）的ADNI基线MRI、FDG-PET和脑脊液（CSF）数据进行了两组实验。在第一组实验中，我们根据基线MRI、FDG-PET和CSF数据估计了两个临床变量，如迷你精神状态检查（MMSE）和阿尔茨海默病评估量表认知亚量表（ADAS-Cog），以及一个分类变量（值为“AD”、“MCI”或“HC”）。在第二组实验中，我们根据基线MRI、FDG-PET和CSF数据预测了MMSE和ADAS-Cog评分的2年变化，以及MCI向AD的转换。两组实验的结果表明，与传统的学习方法相比，我们提出的M3T学习方案在回归和分类任务上都能获得更好的性能。",

Stratifying by gender, vascular risk factors, and AcheI therapy, we observed a significant interaction between education and time in the subgroup of patients who had vascular risk factors, and in those who were not treated with AcheI.\nConclusion\nThese results confirm that schooling may be a significant predictor of cognitive decline as measured by MMSE in persons with AD and provide epidemiological support to “cognitive reserve” model.\n\n【摘要翻译】目的检验高等教育是否通过影响个体的认知储备能力来加速阿尔茨海默病（AD）的进展率。方法我们使用广义估计法研究了162名AD患者的学校教育和其他人口统计学和临床条件（包括年龄、性别、糖尿病、动脉高压和乙酰胆碱酯酶抑制剂AcheI治疗）对简易精神状态检查（MMSE）评分随时间变化的影响，以及学校教育与上述条件的相互作用方程式程序。结果广义估计方程程序的总体进展率为0.24 MMSE分/月。受教育程度≥8年的患者表现出更快的认知能力下降。男性、动脉高压和II型糖尿病的发生以及缺乏AcheI治疗与下降速度加快有关。根据性别、血管风险因素和AcheI治疗进行分层，我们观察到在有血管风险因素的患者亚组和未接受AcheI的患者亚群中，教育和时间之间存在显著的相互作用。结论这些结果证实，学校教育可能是AD患者MMSE测量的认知能力下降的重要预测因素，并为“认知储备”模型提供流行病学支持。",

		"abstract": "Recent studies suggest that combined analysis of Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that measures brain atrophy and positron emission tomography (PET) that quantiﬁes hypo-metabolism provides improved accuracy in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. However, such techniques are limited by the availability of corresponding scans of each modality. Current work focuses on a cross-modal approach to estimate FDG-PET scans for the given MR scans using a 3D U-Net architecture. The use of the complete MR image instead of a local patch based approach helps in capturing non-local and non-linear correlations between MRI and PET modalities. The quality of the estimated PET scans is measured using quantitative metrics such as MAE, PSNR and SSIM. The eﬃcacy of the proposed method is evaluated in the context of Alzheimer’s disease classiﬁcation. The accuracy using only MRI is 70.18% while joint classiﬁcation using synthesized PET and MRI is 74.43% with a p-value of 0.06. The signiﬁcant improvement in diagnosis demonstrates the utility of the synthesized PET scans for multi-modal analysis.\n\n【摘要翻译】最近的研究表明，测量脑萎缩的磁共振成像（MRI）和定量描述低代谢的正电子发射断层扫描（PET）的联合分析提高了诊断阿尔茨海默病的准确性。然而，这种技术受到每个模态的相应扫描的可用性的限制。目前的工作集中在使用3D U-Net架构来估计给定MR扫描的FDG-PET扫描的跨模态方法上。使用完整的MR图像而不是基于局部贴片的方法有助于捕捉MRI和PET模态之间的非局部和非线性相关性。使用诸如MAE、PSNR和SSIM之类的定量度量来测量估计的PET扫描的质量。在阿尔茨海默病分类的背景下评估了所提出方法的有效性。仅使用MRI的准确率为70.18%，而使用合成PET和MRI的关节分类准确率为74.43%，p值为0.06。诊断方面的显著改进证明了合成PET扫描在多模态分析中的实用性。",

		"abstract": "Multi-modality data convey complementary information that can be used to improve the accuracy of prediction models in disease diagnosis. However, effectively integrating multi-modality data remains a challenging problem, especially when the data are incomplete. For instance, more than half of the subjects in the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database have no fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid data. Currently, there are two commonly used strategies to handle the problem of incomplete data: 1) discard samples having missing features; and 2) impute those missing values via specific techniques. In the first case, a significant amount of useful information is lost and, in the second case, additional noise and artifacts might be introduced into the data. Also, previous studies generally focus on the pairwise relationships among subjects, without considering their underlying complex (e.g., high-order) relationships. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a multi-hypergraph learning method for dealing with incomplete multimodality data. Specifically, we first construct multiple hypergraphs to represent the high-order relationships among subjects by dividing them into several groups according to the availability of their data modalities. A hypergraph regularized transductive learning method is then applied to these groups for automatic diagnosis of brain diseases. Extensive evaluation of the proposed method using all subjects in the baseline ADNI database indicates that our method achieves promising results in AD/MCI classification, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n【摘要翻译】多模态数据传达了可用于提高疾病诊断中预测模型准确性的补充信息。然而，有效整合多模态数据仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，尤其是在数据不完整的情况下。例如，阿尔茨海默病神经成像倡议（ADNI）数据库中超过一半的受试者没有氟脱氧葡萄糖正电子发射断层扫描和脑脊液数据。目前，有两种常用的策略来处理不完整数据的问题：1）丢弃具有缺失特征的样本；以及2）通过特定技术估算那些缺失的值。在第一种情况下，丢失了大量有用的信息，在第二种情况下可能会在数据中引入额外的噪声和伪影。此外，先前的研究通常侧重于受试者之间的成对关系，而没有考虑其潜在的复杂（例如，高阶）关系。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种处理不完全多模态数据的多超图学习方法。具体来说，我们首先构建多个超图，根据受试者数据模态的可用性将其分为几组，以表示受试者之间的高阶关系。然后将超图正则化的转导学习方法应用于这些组，用于脑疾病的自动诊断。使用基线ADNI数据库中的所有受试者对所提出的方法进行了广泛的评估，表明与最先进的方法相比，我们的方法在AD/MCI分类方面取得了有希望的结果。",

		"abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease most often associated with memory deficits and cognitive decline, although less common clinical presentations are increasingly recognized. The cardinal pathological features of the disease have been known for more than one hundred years, and today the presence of these amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are still required for a pathological diagnosis. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia globally. There remain no effective treatment options for the great majority of patients, and the primary causes of the disease are unknown except in a small number of familial cases driven by genetic mutations. Confounding efforts to develop effective diagnostic tools and disease-modifying therapies is the realization that Alzheimer’s disease is a mixed proteinopathy (amyloid and tau) frequently associated with other age-related processes such as cerebrovascular disease and Lewy body disease. Defining the relationships between and interdependence of various co-pathologies remains an active area of investigation. This review outlines etiologically-linked pathologic features of Alzheimer’s disease, as well as those that are inevitable findings of uncertain significance, such as granulovacuolar degeneration and Hirano bodies. Other disease processes that are frequent, but not inevitable, are also discussed, including pathologic processes that can clinically mimic Alzheimer’s disease. These include cerebrovascular disease, Lewy body disease, TDP-43 proteinopathies and argyrophilic grain disease. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of Alzheimer’s disease pathology, its defining pathologic substrates and the related pathologies that can affect diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【摘要翻译】阿尔茨海默病是一种进行性神经退行性疾病，通常与记忆缺陷和认知能力下降有关，尽管不太常见的临床表现越来越被认可。这种疾病的基本病理特征已经知道一百多年了，今天这些淀粉样蛋白斑块和神经原纤维缠结的存在仍然是病理诊断所必需的。阿尔茨海默病是全球痴呆症最常见的病因。对于绝大多数患者来说，仍然没有有效的治疗选择，除了少数由基因突变引起的家族性病例外，该疾病的主要原因尚不清楚。开发有效诊断工具和疾病改良疗法的努力令人困惑的是，人们意识到阿尔茨海默病是一种混合蛋白病（淀粉样蛋白和tau蛋白），经常与其他与年龄相关的过程有关，如脑血管病和路易体病。定义各种共病之间的关系和相互依存关系仍然是一个活跃的研究领域。这篇综述概述了阿尔茨海默病的病因相关病理特征，以及那些具有不确定意义的不可避免的发现，如颗粒细胞变性和平野体。还讨论了其他常见但并非不可避免的疾病过程，包括临床上可以模拟阿尔茨海默病的病理过程。其中包括脑血管病、路易体病、TDP-43蛋白病和嗜银性谷物病。这篇综述的目的是概述阿尔茨海默病的病理学、其定义的病理基础以及可能影响诊断和治疗的相关病理学。",

		"abstract": "Cognitive reserve (CR) is the brain’s capacity to cope with cerebral damage to minimize clinical manifestations. The ‘passive model’ considers head or brain measures as anatomical substrates of CR, whereas the ‘active model’ emphasizes the use of brain networks effectively. Sixteen healthy subjects, 12 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 16 cases with mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were included to investigate the relationships between proxies of CR and cerebral measures considered in the ‘passive’ and ‘active’ models. CR proxies were inferred premorbid IQ (WAIS Vocabulary test), ‘education–occupation’, a questionnaire of intellectual and social activities and a composite CR measure. MRI-derived whole-brain volumes and brain activity by functional MRI during a visual encoding task were obtained. Among healthy elders, higher CR was related to larger brains and reduced activity during cognitive processing, suggesting more effective use of cerebral networks. In contrast, higher CR was associated with reduced brain volumes in MCI and AD and increased brain function in the latter, indicating more advanced neuropathology but that active compensatory mechanisms are still at work in higher CR patients. The right superior temporal gyrus (BA 22) and the left superior parietal lobe (BA 7) showed greatest signiﬁcant differences in direction of slope with CR and activation between controls and AD cases. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that fMRI patterns were more closely related to CR proxies than brain volumes. Overall, inverse relationships for healthy and pathological aging groups emerged between brain structure and function and CR variables.\n\n【摘要翻译】认知储备（CR）是大脑应对脑损伤以尽量减少临床表现的能力。“被动模型”将头部或大脑测量视为CR的解剖学基础，而“主动模型”则强调有效地使用大脑网络。纳入16名健康受试者、12名遗忘性轻度认知障碍（MCI）和16名轻度阿尔茨海默病（AD）患者，以研究CR指标与“被动”和“主动”模型中考虑的大脑测量之间的关系。CR指标是推断出患病前智商（WAIS词汇测试）、“教育-职业”、智力和社会活动问卷以及综合CR测量。在视觉编码任务期间，通过功能MRI获得MRI衍生的全脑体积和大脑活动。在健康的老年人中，较高的CR与较大的大脑和认知过程中活动减少有关，这表明大脑网络的使用更有效。相反，较高的CR与MCI和AD的脑容量减少以及后者的脑功能增加有关，这表明更先进的神经病理学，但在较高的CR患者中，积极的代偿机制仍在发挥作用。右颞上回（BA 22）和左顶叶上叶（BA 7）在CR和激活的斜坡方向上显示出对照组和AD病例之间最大的显著差异。最后，回归分析显示，功能磁共振成像模式与CR指标的关系比大脑体积更密切。总体而言，健康和病理衰老组的大脑结构和功能与CR变量之间出现了相反的关系。",

		"abstract": "Deep learning, a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, has shown outstanding performance over traditional machine learning in identifying intricate structures in complex high-dimensional data, especially in the domain of computer vision. The application of deep learning to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0% for AD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such as—omics data, increasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features and mechanisms.\n\n【摘要翻译】深度学习是一种最先进的机器学习方法，在识别复杂高维数据中的复杂结构方面，特别是在计算机视觉领域，表现出了优于传统机器学习的卓越性能。深度学习在阿尔茨海默病（AD）早期检测和自动分类中的应用最近受到了相当大的关注，因为神经成像技术的快速进步已经产生了大规模的多模式神经成像数据。对使用深度学习方法和神经影像学数据进行AD诊断分类的出版物进行了系统综述。PubMed和谷歌学者搜索用于识别2013年1月至2018年7月期间发表的关于AD的深度学习论文。对这些论文进行了综述、评价，并按算法和神经成像类型进行了分类，并对研究结果进行了总结。在符合完全纳入标准的16项研究中，4项结合了深度学习和传统机器学习方法，12项仅使用深度学习方法。用于分类的传统机器学习和用于特征选择的堆叠式自动编码器（SAE）的组合产生了高达98.8%的AD分类准确率和83.7%的从轻度认知障碍（AD的前驱阶段）到AD的转换预测准确率，诸如卷积神经网络（CNN）或递归神经网络（RNN）的在没有预处理的情况下使用神经成像数据进行特征选择的方法已经产生了高达96.0%的AD分类准确率和84.2%的MCI转换预测准确率。当多模式神经成像和流体生物标志物相结合时，获得了最佳的分类性能。深度学习方法的性能不断提高，似乎有望利用多模式神经成像数据对AD进行诊断分类。使用深度学习的AD研究仍在发展中，通过结合额外的混合数据类型（如组学数据）提高了性能，并通过增加特定疾病相关特征和机制知识的可解释方法提高了透明度。",

		"abstract": "Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries. From a research point of view, impressive results have been reported using computer-aided algorithms, but clinically no practical diagnostic method is available. In recent years, deep models have become popular, especially in dealing with images. Since 2013, deep learning has begun to gain considerable attention in AD detection research, with the number of published papers in this area increasing drastically since 2017. Deep models have been reported to be more accurate for AD detection compared to general machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, AD detection is still challenging, and for classification, it requires a highly discriminative feature representation to separate similar brain patterns. This paper reviews the current state of AD detection using deep learning. Through a systematic literature review of over 100 articles, we set out the most recent findings and trends. Specifically, we review useful biomarkers and features (personal information, genetic data, and brain scans), the necessary pre-processing steps, and different ways of dealing with neuroimaging data originating from single-modality and multi-modality studies. Deep models and their performance are described in detail. Although deep learning has achieved notable performance in detecting AD, there are several limitations, especially regarding the availability of datasets and training procedures.\n\n【摘要翻译】阿尔茨海默病（AD）是发达国家死亡的主要原因之一。从研究的角度来看，使用计算机辅助算法已经报告了令人印象深刻的结果，但临床上没有实用的诊断方法。近年来，深度模型变得流行起来，尤其是在处理图像方面。自2013年以来，深度学习开始在AD检测研究中获得相当大的关注，自2017年以来，该领域发表的论文数量急剧增加。据报道，与一般的机器学习技术相比，深度模型对AD检测更准确。尽管如此，AD检测仍然具有挑战性，对于分类来说，它需要高度判别的特征表示来分离相似的大脑模式。本文综述了利用深度学习进行AD检测的现状。通过对100多篇文章的系统文献综述，我们列出了最新的发现和趋势。具体而言，我们回顾了有用的生物标志物和特征（个人信息、遗传数据和大脑扫描）、必要的预处理步骤，以及处理源自单模态和多模态研究的神经成像数据的不同方法。详细描述了深度模型及其性能。尽管深度学习在检测AD方面取得了显著的性能，但仍存在一些局限性，特别是在数据集和训练程序的可用性方面。",

		"abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) has been substantially used recently. To minimize the potential health risk caused by the tracer radiation inherent to PET scans, it is of great interest to synthesize the high-quality PET image from the low-dose one to reduce the radiation exposure. In this paper, we propose a 3D auto-context-based locality adaptive multi-modality generative adversarial networks model (LA-GANs) to synthesize the high-quality FDG PET image from the low-dose one with the accompanying MRI images that provide anatomical information. Our work has four contributions. First, different from the traditional methods that treat each image modality as an input channel and apply the same kernel to convolve the whole image, we argue that the contributions of different modalities could vary at different image locations, and therefore a unified kernel for a whole image is not optimal. To address this issue, we propose a locality adaptive strategy for multi-modality fusion. Second, we utilize $1 \\times 1 \\times 1$ kernel to learn this locality adaptive fusion so that the number of additional parameters incurred by our method is kept minimum. Third, the proposed locality adaptive fusion mechanism is learned jointly with the PET image synthesis in a 3D conditional GANs model, which generates high-quality PET images by employing large-sized image patches and hierarchical features. Fourth, we apply the auto-context strategy to our scheme and propose an auto-context LA-GANs model to further refine the quality of synthesized images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the traditional multi-modality fusion methods used in deep networks, as well as the state-of-the-art PET estimation approaches.\n\n【摘要翻译】正电子发射断层扫描（PET）最近已被大量使用。为了最大限度地减少PET扫描固有的示踪辐射引起的潜在健康风险，从低剂量图像合成高质量的PET图像以减少辐射暴露是非常有意义的。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于3D自动上下文的局部自适应多模态生成对抗性网络模型（LA-GAN），以将低剂量FDG PET图像与提供解剖信息的MRI图像合成为高质量FDG PET。我们的工作有四个贡献。首先，与将每个图像模态视为输入通道并应用相同的核来卷积整个图像的传统方法不同，我们认为不同模态的贡献在不同的图像位置可能不同，因此整个图像的统一核不是最优的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种用于多模态融合的局部自适应策略。其次，我们利用$1\\times 1\\times 1$核来学习这种局部自适应融合，从而使我们的方法产生的附加参数的数量保持最小。第三，在3D条件GANs模型中，将所提出的局部自适应融合机制与PET图像合成相结合，通过使用大尺寸的图像块和层次特征来生成高质量的PET图像。第四，我们将自动上下文策略应用于我们的方案，并提出了一个自动上下文LA-GAN模型来进一步细化合成图像的质量。实验结果表明，我们的方法优于深度网络中使用的传统多模态融合方法，以及最先进的PET估计方法。",

		"abstract": "With the advance of medical imaging technologies, multimodal images such as magnetic resonance images (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) can capture subtle structural and functional changes of brain, facilitating the diagnosis of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In practice, multimodal images may be incomplete since PET is often missing due to high financial costs or availability. Most of the existing methods simply excluded subjects with missing data, which unfortunately reduced the sample size. In addition, how to extract and combine multimodal features is still challenging. To address these problems, we propose a deep learning framework to integrate a task-induced pyramid and attention generative adversarial network (TPA-GAN) with a pathwise transfer dense convolution network (PT-DCN) for imputation and classification of multimodal brain images. First, we propose a TPA-GAN to integrate pyramid convolution and attention module as well as disease classification task into GAN for generating the missing PET data with their MRI. Then, with the imputed multimodal images, we build a dense convolution network with pathwise transfer blocks to gradually learn and combine multimodal features for final disease classification. Experiments are performed on ADNI-1/2 datasets to evaluate our method, achieving superior performance in image imputation and brain disease diagnosis compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n\n【摘要翻译】随着医学成像技术的进步，磁共振成像（MRI）和正电子发射断层扫描（PET）等多模式图像可以捕捉大脑细微的结构和功能变化，有助于阿尔茨海默病（AD）等脑部疾病的诊断。在实践中，多模式图像可能是不完整的，因为PET由于高财务成本或可用性而经常丢失。大多数现有的方法只是简单地排除了数据缺失的受试者，这不幸地减少了样本量。此外，如何提取和组合多模式特征仍然具有挑战性。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个深度学习框架，将任务诱导金字塔和注意力生成对抗性网络（TPA-GAN）与路径转移密集卷积网络（PT-DCN）相结合，用于多模式脑图像的插补和分类。首先，我们提出了一种TPA-GAN，将金字塔卷积和注意力模块以及疾病分类任务集成到GAN中，以通过其MRI生成缺失的PET数据。然后，利用估算的多模式图像，我们构建了一个具有路径转移块的密集卷积网络，以逐步学习和组合多模式特征，用于最终的疾病分类。在ADNI-1/2数据集上进行了实验，以评估我们的方法，与最先进的方法相比，在图像插补和脑部疾病诊断方面取得了卓越的性能。",

These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping.

We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Indeed, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, a large number of internet users (many of them artists) have posted their own experiments with our system, further demonstrating its wide applicability and ease of adoption without the need for parameter tweaking.

The fusion of multiple data modalities can provide a holistic view of AD staging analysis. Thus, we use deep learning (DL) to integrally analyze imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)), and clinical test data to classify patients into AD, MCI, and controls (CN). We use stacked denoising auto-encoders to extract features from clinical and genetic data, and use 3D-convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for imaging data. We also develop a novel data interpretation method to identify top-performing features learned by the deep-models with clustering and perturbation analysis. Using Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset, we demonstrate that deep models outperform shallow models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors.

New measures are needed to improve the diagnosis of individuals with cognitive impairment due to various etiologies. Here, we report a deep learning framework that accomplishes multiple diagnostic steps in successive fashion to identify persons with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and non-AD dementias (nADD). We demonstrate a range of models capable of accepting flexible combinations of routinely collected clinical information, including demographics, medical history, neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging, and functional assessments. We then show that these frameworks compare favorably with the diagnostic accuracy of practicing neurologists and neuroradiologists. Lastly, we apply interpretability methods in computer vision to show that disease-specific patterns detected by our models track distinct patterns of degenerative changes throughout the brain and correspond closely with the presence of neuropathological lesions on autopsy. Our work demonstrates methodologies for validating computational predictions with established standards of medical diagnosis.\n\n【摘要翻译】摘要在全球范围内，每年有近1000万例新的痴呆症病例，其中阿尔茨海默病（AD）是最常见的。需要采取新的措施来改善因各种病因导致的认知障碍患者的诊断。在这里，我们报告了一个深度学习框架，该框架以连续的方式完成多个诊断步骤，以识别患有正常认知（NC）、轻度认知障碍（MCI）、AD和非AD痴呆（nADD）的人。我们展示了一系列能够接受常规收集的临床信息的灵活组合的模型，包括人口统计、病史、神经心理测试、神经成像和功能评估。然后我们证明，这些框架与执业神经学家和神经放射科医生的诊断准确性相比是有利的。最后，我们在计算机视觉中应用了可解释性方法，以表明我们的模型检测到的疾病特异性模式跟踪整个大脑的退行性变化的不同模式，并与尸检中神经病理学损伤的存在密切对应。我们的工作展示了用既定的医学诊断标准验证计算预测的方法。",

		"abstract": "Purpose: The incorporation of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has allowed for enhanced image-guided radiation therapy. While CBCT allows for daily 3D imaging, images suffer from severe artifacts, limiting the clinical potential of CBCT. In this work, a deep learning-based method for generating high quality corrected CBCT (CCBCT) images is proposed.\nMethods: The proposed method integrates a residual block concept into a cycle-consistent adversarial network (cycle-GAN) framework, called res-cycle GAN, to learn a mapping between CBCT images and paired planning CT images. Compared with a GAN, a cycle-GAN includes an inverse transformation from CBCT to CT images, which constrains the model by forcing calculation of both a CCBCT and a synthetic CBCT. A fully convolution neural network with residual blocks is used in the generator to enable end-to-end CBCT-to-CT transformations. The proposed algorithm was evaluated using 24 sets of patient data in the brain and 20 sets of patient data in the pelvis. The mean absolute error (MAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), normalized cross-correlation (NCC) indices, and spatial non-uniformity (SNU) were used to quantify the correction accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The proposed method is compared to both a conventional scatter correction and another machine learning-based CBCT correction method.\nResults: Overall, the MAE, PSNR, NCC, and SNU were 13.0 HU, 37.5 dB, 0.99, and 0.05 in the brain, 16.1 HU, 30.7 dB, 0.98, and 0.09 in the pelvis for the proposed method, improvements of 45%, 16%, 1%, and 93% in the brain, and 71%, 38%, 2%, and 65% in the pelvis, over the CBCT image. The proposed method showed superior image quality as compared to the scatter correction method, reducing noise and artifact severity. The proposed method produced images with less noise and artifacts than the comparison machine learning-based method.\nConclusions: The authors have developed a novel deep learning-based method to generate highquality corrected CBCT images. The proposed method increases onboard CBCT image quality, making it comparable to that of the planning CT. With further evaluation and clinical implementation, this method could lead to quantitative adaptive radiation therapy. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13656]\n\n【摘要翻译】目的：结合锥束计算机断层扫描（CBCT）可以增强图像引导的放射治疗。虽然CBCT允许每天进行3D成像，但图像会出现严重的伪影，限制了CBCT的临床潜力。在这项工作中，提出了一种基于深度学习的生成高质量校正CBCT（CCBCT）图像的方法。方法：所提出的方法将残差块概念集成到循环一致对抗性网络（cycle-GAN）框架中，称为res-cycle-GAN，以学习CBCT图像和成对规划CT图像之间的映射。与GAN相比，循环GAN包括从CBCT到CT图像的逆变换，其通过强制计算CCBCT和合成CBCT来约束模型。生成器中使用了具有残差块的完全卷积神经网络来实现端到端的CBCT到CT转换。使用大脑中的24组患者数据和骨盆中的20组患者数据对所提出的算法进行了评估。使用平均绝对误差（MAE）、峰值信噪比（PSNR）、归一化互相关（NCC）指数和空间不均匀性（SNU）来量化所提出算法的校正精度。将所提出的方法与传统的散射校正和另一种基于机器学习的CBCT校正方法进行了比较。结果：总体而言，所提出的方法在大脑中的MAE、PSNR、NCC和SNU分别为13.0 HU、37.5 dB、0.99和0.05，在骨盆中为16.1 HU、30.7 dB、0.98和0.09，与CBCT图像相比，在大脑中改善了45%、16%、1%和93%，在骨盆改善了71%、38%、2%和65%。与散射校正方法相比，所提出的方法显示出优越的图像质量，降低了噪声和伪影的严重程度。与基于比较机器学习的方法相比，所提出的方法产生的图像具有更少的噪声和伪影。结论：作者开发了一种新的基于深度学习的方法来生成高质量的校正CBCT图像。所提出的方法提高了机载CBCT图像质量，使其与计划CT的图像质量相当。随着进一步的评估和临床实施，该方法可能导致定量自适应放射治疗。©2019美国医学物理学家协会[https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13656]",

However, there are some common concerns in PET scans including the high cost, the usage of radioactive tracer and so on. These factors jointly result in a lack of PET datas. To overcome this limitation, in this study we proposed an effective U-Net architecture with the adversarial training strategy to synthesizing PET datas from their corresponding MRI. In addition, we notice that many prior works commonly adopted Batch Normalization (BN) as the normalization method by default. But in this specific task which always needs a small mini-batch, BN’s performance decreases rapidly. To alleviate this issue, we compared the performance of using other popular normalization methods rather than using BN as default. Experimental results on a subset of ADNI database demonstrated that the synthetic PET images from our proposed method were reasonable, and it was valuable to replace the Batch Normalization with the Instance Normalization in the tasks of cross-modality synthesis.

Our goal is to learn a mapping G : X → Y such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the distribution Y using an adversarial loss.

		"abstract": "Background and Objective: Multi-modal medical images, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), have been widely used for the diagnosis of brain disorder diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) since they can provide various information. PET scans can detect cellular changes in organs and tissues earlier than MRI. Unlike MRI, PET data is diﬃcult to acquire due to cost, radiation, or other limitations. Moreover, PET data is missing for many subjects in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. To solve this problem, a 3D end-to-end generative adversarial network (named BPGAN) is proposed to synthesize brain PET from MRI scans, which can be used as a potential data completion scheme for multi-modal medical image research.\nMethods: We propose BPGAN, which learns an end-to-end mapping function to transform the input MRI scans to their underlying PET scans. First, we design a 3D multiple convolution U-Net (MCU) generator architecture to improve the visual quality of synthetic results while preserving the diverse brain structures of different subjects. By further employing a 3D gradient proﬁle (GP) loss and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) loss, the synthetic PET scans have higher-similarity to the ground truth. In this study, we explore alternative data partitioning ways to study their impact on the performance of the proposed method in different medical scenarios.\nResults: We conduct experiments on a publicly available ADNI database. The proposed BPGAN is evaluated by mean absolute error (MAE), peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and SSIM, superior to other compared models in these quantitative evaluation metrics. Qualitative evaluations also validate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, combined with MRI and our synthetic PET scans, the accuracies of multi-class AD diagnosis on dataset-A and dataset-B are 85.00% and 56.47%, which have been improved by about 1% and 1%, respectively, compared to the stand-alone MRI.\nConclusions: The experimental results of quantitative measures, qualitative displays, and classiﬁcation evaluation demonstrate that the synthetic PET images by BPGAN are reasonable and high-quality, which provide complementary information to improve the performance of AD diagnosis. This work provides a valuable reference for multi-modal medical image analysis.\n\n【摘要翻译】背景与目的：磁共振成像（MRI）和正电子发射断层扫描（PET）等多模态医学图像由于能够提供各种信息，已被广泛用于阿尔茨海默病等脑疾病的诊断。PET扫描可以比MRI更早地检测器官和组织中的细胞变化。与MRI不同，PET数据由于成本、辐射或其他限制而难以获取。此外，阿尔茨海默病神经成像倡议（ADNI）数据集中许多受试者的PET数据缺失。为了解决这个问题，提出了一种3D端到端生成对抗性网络（命名为BPGAN）来从MRI扫描中合成大脑PET，这可以作为多模态医学图像研究的潜在数据完成方案。方法：我们提出了BPGAN，它学习端到端映射函数，将输入的MRI扫描转换为其基础PET扫描。首先，我们设计了一种3D多重卷积U-Net（MCU）生成器架构，以提高合成结果的视觉质量，同时保留不同受试者的不同大脑结构。通过进一步采用3D梯度文件（GP）损失和结构相似性指数测量（SSIM）损失，合成PET扫描与基本事实具有更高的相似性。在这项研究中，我们探索了替代的数据划分方法，以研究它们对所提出的方法在不同医疗场景中的性能的影响。结果：我们在公开的ADNI数据库上进行了实验。所提出的BPGAN通过平均绝对误差（MAE）、峰值信噪比（PSNR）和SSIM进行评估，在这些定量评估指标上优于其他比较模型。定性评估也验证了我们方法的有效性。此外，结合MRI和我们的合成PET扫描，数据集A和数据集B的多类AD诊断准确率分别为85.00%和56.47%，与独立MRI相比，这两个准确率分别提高了约1%和1%。结论：定量测量、定性显示和分类评估的实验结果表明，BPGAN合成的PET图像合理、高质量，为提高AD诊断性能提供了补充信息。这项工作为多模态医学图像分析提供了宝贵的参考。",

		"abstract": "Many image-to-image translation problems are ambiguous, as a single input image may correspond to multiple possible outputs. In this work, we aim to model a distribution of possible outputs in a conditional generative modeling setting. The ambiguity of the mapping is distilled in a low-dimensional latent vector, which can be randomly sampled at test time. A generator learns to map the given input, combined with this latent code, to the output. We explicitly encourage the connection between output and the latent code to be invertible. This helps prevent a many-to-one mapping from the latent code to the output during training, also known as the problem of mode collapse, and produces more diverse results. We explore several variants of this approach by employing different training objectives, network architectures, and methods of injecting the latent code. Our proposed method encourages bijective consistency between the latent encoding and output modes.

However, PET data is not always available for several reasons, such as high cost, radiation hazard, and other limitations. This paper proposes a 3D end-to-end synthesis network called Bidirectional Mapping Generative Adversarial Networks (BMGAN). Image contexts and latent vectors are effectively used for brain MR-to-PET synthesis. Speciﬁcally, a bidirectional mapping mechanism is designed to embed the semantic information of PET images into the high-dimensional latent space. Moreover, the 3D Dense-UNet generator architecture and the hybrid loss functions are further constructed to improve the visual quality of cross-modality synthetic images. The most appealing part is that the proposed method can synthesize perceptually realistic PET images while preserving the diverse brain structures of different subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method outperforms other competitive methods in terms of quantitative measures, qualitative displays, and evaluation metrics for classiﬁcation.\n\n【摘要翻译】融合多模态医学图像，如磁共振（MR）成像和正电子发射断层扫描（PET），可以提供有关人体的各种解剖和功能信息。然而，由于几个原因，PET数据并不总是可用的，例如高成本、辐射危害和其他限制。本文提出了一种三维端到端合成网络，称为双向映射生成对抗性网络（BMGAN）。图像上下文和潜在向量被有效地用于脑MR到PET的合成。具体而言，设计了一种双向映射机制，将PET图像的语义信息嵌入到高维潜在空间中。此外，进一步构建了3D密集UNet生成器架构和混合损失函数，以提高跨模态合成图像的视觉质量。最吸引人的部分是，所提出的方法可以合成感知逼真的PET图像，同时保留不同受试者的不同大脑结构。实验结果表明，所提出的方法在定量测量、定性显示和分类评估指标方面优于其他竞争方法。",

New measures are needed to improve the diagnosis of individuals with cognitive impairment due to various etiologies. Here, we report a deep learning framework that accomplishes multiple diagnostic steps in successive fashion to identify persons with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and non-AD dementias (nADD). We demonstrate a range of models capable of accepting flexible combinations of routinely collected clinical information, including demographics, medical history, neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging, and functional assessments. We then show that these frameworks compare favorably with the diagnostic accuracy of practicing neurologists and neuroradiologists. Lastly, we apply interpretability methods in computer vision to show that disease-specific patterns detected by our models track distinct patterns of degenerative changes throughout the brain and correspond closely with the presence of neuropathological lesions on autopsy. Our work demonstrates methodologies for validating computational predictions with established standards of medical diagnosis.\n\n【摘要翻译】摘要在全球范围内，每年有近1000万例新的痴呆症病例，其中阿尔茨海默病（AD）是最常见的。需要采取新的措施来改善因各种病因导致的认知障碍患者的诊断。在这里，我们报告了一个深度学习框架，该框架以连续的方式完成多个诊断步骤，以识别患有正常认知（NC）、轻度认知障碍（MCI）、AD和非AD痴呆（nADD）的人。我们展示了一系列能够接受常规收集的临床信息的灵活组合的模型，包括人口统计、病史、神经心理测试、神经成像和功能评估。然后我们证明，这些框架与执业神经学家和神经放射科医生的诊断准确性相比是有利的。最后，我们在计算机视觉中应用了可解释性方法，以表明我们的模型检测到的疾病特异性模式跟踪整个大脑的退行性变化的不同模式，并与尸检中神经病理学损伤的存在密切对应。我们的工作展示了用既定的医学诊断标准验证计算预测的方法。",

In this work, we demonstrate how computational multi-scale brain modeling links phenomena of different scales and therefore identifies potential disease mechanisms leading the way to improved diagnostics and treatment.Methods: The Virtual Brain (TVB; thevirtualbrain.org) neuroinformatics platform allows standardized large-scale structural connectivity-based simulations of whole brain dynamics. We provide proof of concept for a novel approach that quantitatively links the effects of altered molecular pathways onto neuronal population dynamics. As a novelty, we connect chemical compounds measured with positron emission tomography (PET) with neural function in TVB addressing the phenomenon of hyperexcitability in AD related to the protein amyloid beta (Abeta). We construct personalized virtual brains based on an averaged healthy connectome and individual PET derived distributions of Abeta in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N = 8) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD, N = 10) and in age-matched healthy controls (HC, N = 15) using data from ADNI-3 data base (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). In the personalized virtual brains, individual Abeta burden modulates regional Excitation-Inhibition balance, leading to local hyperexcitation with high Abeta loads. We analyze simulated regional neural activity and electroencephalograms (EEG).Results: Known empirical alterations of EEG in patients with AD compared to HCs were reproduced by simulations. The virtual AD group showed slower frequencies in simulated local field potentials and EEG compared to MCI and HC groups. The heterogeneity of the Abeta load is crucial for the virtual EEG slowing which is absent for control models with homogeneous Abeta distributions. Slowing phenomena primarily affect the network hubs, independent of the spatial distribution of Abeta. Modeling the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism of memantine in local population models, reveals potential functional reversibility of the observed large-scale alterations (reflected by EEG slowing) in virtual AD brains.Discussion: We demonstrate how TVB enables the simulation of systems effects caused by pathogenetic molecular candidate mechanisms in human virtual brains.\n\n【摘要翻译】引言：虽然与痴呆症相关的神经退行性疾病（如阿尔茨海默病）的患病率增加，但我们对潜在机制、结果预测因素或治疗靶点的了解有限。在这项工作中，我们展示了计算多尺度大脑建模如何将不同尺度的现象联系起来，从而确定潜在的疾病机制，从而改善诊断和治疗。方法：虚拟大脑（TVB；thevirtualbrain.org）神经信息学平台允许基于标准化大规模结构连接的全脑动力学模拟。我们为一种新的方法提供了概念证明，该方法将改变的分子途径对神经元群体动力学的影响定量联系起来。作为一项新颖的研究，我们将正电子发射断层扫描（PET）测量的化合物与TVB中的神经功能联系起来，以解决AD中与β淀粉样蛋白（Abeta）相关的过度兴奋现象。我们使用来自ADNI-3数据库的数据，基于轻度认知障碍（MCI，N=8）和阿尔茨海默病（AD，N=10）患者以及年龄匹配的健康对照组（HC，N=15）中Abeta的平均健康连接组和个体PET衍生分布，构建了个性化的虚拟大脑(http://adni.loni.usc.edu)。在个性化的虚拟大脑中，个体阿贝塔负荷调节区域兴奋-抑制平衡，导致高阿贝塔负荷的局部过度兴奋。我们分析了模拟的区域神经活动和脑电图（EEG）。结果：模拟再现了AD患者与HC患者脑电图的已知经验变化。与MCI和HC组相比，虚拟AD组在模拟的局部场电位和EEG中显示出较慢的频率。Abeta负荷的异质性对于虚拟EEG减慢至关重要，而对于具有均匀Abeta分布的控制模型来说，这是不存在的。减速现象主要影响网络枢纽，与Abeta的空间分布无关。在局部群体模型中对美金刚的N-甲基-D-天冬氨酸（NMDA）受体拮抗作用进行建模，揭示了在虚拟AD大脑中观察到的大规模改变（反映为脑电图减慢）的潜在功能可逆性。讨论：我们展示了TVB如何能够模拟人类虚拟大脑中由致病分子候选机制引起的系统效应。",

		"abstract": "Structures matter in single image super-resolution (SISR). Benefiting from generative adversarial networks (GANs), recent studies have promoted the development of SISR by recovering photo-realistic images. However, there are still undesired structural distortions in the recovered images. In this paper, we propose a structure-preserving super-resolution (SPSR) method to alleviate the above issue while maintaining the merits of GAN-based methods to generate perceptual-pleasant details. Firstly, we propose SPSR with gradient guidance (SPSR-G) by exploiting gradient maps of images to guide the recovery in two aspects. On the one hand, we restore high-resolution gradient maps by a gradient branch to provide additional structure priors for the SR process. On the other hand, we propose a gradient loss to impose a second-order restriction on the super-resolved images, which helps generative networks concentrate more on geometric structures. Secondly, since the gradient maps are handcrafted and may only be able to capture limited aspects of structural information, we further extend SPSR-G by introducing a learnable neural structure extractor (NSE) to unearth richer local structures and provide stronger supervision for SR. We propose two self-supervised structure learning methods, contrastive prediction and solving jigsaw puzzles, to train the NSEs. Our methods are model-agnostic, which can be potentially used for off-the-shelf SR networks. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art perceptual-driven SR methods under LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM metrics. Visual results demonstrate the superiority of our methods in restoring structures while generating natural SR images.

The KL divergence between two Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) is frequently needed in the fields of speech and image recognition. Unfortunately the KL divergence between two GMMs is not analytically tractable, nor does any efficient computational algorithm exist. Some techniques cope with this problem by replacing the KL divergence with other functions that can be computed efficiently. We introduce two new methods, the variational approximation and the variational upper bound, and compare them to existing methods. We discuss seven different techniques in total and weigh the benefits of each one against the others.

		"abstract": "We present a novel method that integrates subspace modeling with an adaptive generative image prior for high-dimensional MR image reconstruction. The subspace model imposes an explicit low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional images, while the generative image prior serves as a spatial constraint on the \"contrast-weighted\" images or the spatial coefficients of the subspace model. A formulation was introduced to synergize these two components with complimentary regularization such as joint sparsity. A special pretraining plus subject-specific network adaptation strategy was proposed to construct an accurate generative-model-based representation for images with varying contrasts, validated by experimental data. An iterative algorithm was introduced to jointly update the subspace coefficients and the multiresolution latent space of the generative image model that leveraged a recently developed intermediate layer optimization technique for network inversion. We evaluated the utility of the proposed method in two high-dimensional imaging applications: accelerated MR parameter mapping and high-resolution MRSI. Improved performance over state-of-the-art subspace-based methods was demonstrated in both cases. Our work demonstrated the potential of integrating data-driven and adaptive generative models with low-dimensional representation for high-dimensional imaging problems.\n\n【摘要翻译】我们提出了一种新的方法，将子空间建模与自适应生成图像先验相结合，用于高维MR图像重建。子空间模型强加了高维图像的显式低维表示，而生成图像先验充当了对“对比度加权”图像或子空间模型的空间系数的空间约束。引入了一个公式，通过互补正则化（如联合稀疏性）来协同这两个分量。提出了一种特殊的预训练加上特定主题的网络自适应策略，为具有不同对比度的图像构建了一种精确的基于生成模型的表示，并通过实验数据进行了验证。引入了一种迭代算法来联合更新生成图像模型的子空间系数和多分辨率潜在空间，该算法利用了最近开发的用于网络反演的中间层优化技术。我们评估了所提出的方法在两个高维成像应用中的效用：加速MR参数映射和高分辨率MRSI。在这两种情况下，都证明了与最先进的基于子空间的方法相比，性能有所提高。我们的工作证明了将数据驱动和自适应生成模型与高维成像问题的低维表示相结合的潜力。",

However, collecting the full set of well-aligned and paired data is expensive or even impractical, since the practical difficulties may include high cost, long time acquisition, image corruption, and privacy issues. A realistic solution is to explore either an unsupervised learning or a semi-supervised learning to synthesize the absent neuroimaging data. In this paper, we are the first one to comprehensively approach cross-modality neuroimage synthesis task from different perspectives, which include the level of the supervision (especially for weakly-supervised and unsupervised), loss function, evaluation metrics, the range of modality synthesis, datasets (aligned, private and public) and the synthesis-based downstream tasks. To begin with, we highlight several opening challenges for cross-modality neuroimage sysnthesis. Then we summarize the architecture of cross-modality synthesis under various of supervision level. In addition, we provide in-depth analysis of how cross-modality neuroimage synthesis can improve the performance of different downstream tasks.

		"abstract": "Many image-to-image translation problems are ambiguous, as a single input image may correspond to multiple possible outputs. In this work, we aim to model a distribution of possible outputs in a conditional generative modeling setting. The ambiguity of the mapping is distilled in a low-dimensional latent vector, which can be randomly sampled at test time. A generator learns to map the given input, combined with this latent code, to the output. We explicitly encourage the connection between output and the latent code to be invertible. This helps prevent a many-to-one mapping from the latent code to the output during training, also known as the problem of mode collapse, and produces more diverse results. We explore several variants of this approach by employing different training objectives, network architectures, and methods of injecting the latent code. Our proposed method encourages bijective consistency between the latent encoding and output modes. We present a systematic comparison of our method and other variants on both perceptual realism and diversity.\n\n【摘要翻译】许多图像到图像的翻译问题是模糊的，因为单个输入图像可能对应于多个可能的输出。在这项工作中，我们的目标是在条件生成建模环境中对可能输出的分布进行建模。映射的模糊性在低维潜在向量中提取，该向量可以在测试时随机采样。生成器学习将给定的输入与该潜在代码相结合映射到输出。我们明确鼓励输出和潜在代码之间的连接是可逆的。这有助于防止在训练期间从潜在代码到输出的多对一映射，也称为模式崩溃问题，并产生更多样的结果。我们通过采用不同的训练目标、网络架构和注入潜在代码的方法来探索这种方法的几种变体。我们提出的方法鼓励潜在编码和输出模式之间的双射一致性。我们对我们的方法和其他变体在感知现实主义和多样性方面进行了系统的比较。",

		"abstract": "The identification of biological markers at early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) contributes to diagnostic accuracy and adds prognostic value. However, in spite of recent developments, results of neurostructural imaging studies on predicting conversion to AD are not uniform. We conducted a systematic review of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies about the neurostructural predictors of conversion to AD. Ten studies met inclusion criteria and nine reported baseline regional gray matter (GM) atrophy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or healthy subjects who progressed to AD. Using the method of Activation Likelihood Estimation, we meta-analyzed the coordinates from the six longitudinal VBM studies that enrolled subjects with amnestic MCI (aMCI) at baseline. These comprised a total of 429 aMCI subjects, of which 142 converted to AD. Meta-analysis yielded one significant cluster of GM volumetric reduction in aMCI patients who converted to AD, located in the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. In conclusion, left medial temporal lobe atrophy is the most consistent neurostructural biomarker to predict conversion from aMCI to AD.\n\n【摘要翻译】阿尔茨海默病（AD）早期生物学标志物的鉴定有助于提高诊断准确性并增加预后价值。然而，尽管最近取得了进展，但神经结构成像研究预测AD转化的结果并不一致。我们对基于体素的形态计量学（VBM）研究进行了系统回顾，这些研究涉及AD转换的神经结构预测因素。10项研究符合纳入标准，9项研究报告了轻度认知障碍（MCI）或进展为AD的健康受试者的基线区域灰质（GM）萎缩。使用激活似然估计方法，我们荟萃分析了六项纵向VBM研究的坐标，这些研究在基线时招募了患有遗忘性MCI（aMCI）的受试者。共有429名aMCI受试者，其中142人转为AD。荟萃分析显示，在转为AD的aMCI患者中，位于左海马和海马旁回的GM体积显著减少。总之，左内侧颞叶萎缩是预测从aMCI向AD转化的最一致的神经结构生物标志物。",

ADAD arises from mutations occurring in three genes. Offspring from ADAD families have a 50% chance of inheriting their familial mutation, so non-carrier siblings can be recruited for comparisons in case–control studies. The age of onset in ADAD is highly predictable within families, allowing researchers to estimate an individual’s point in the disease trajectory. These characteristics allow candidate AD biomarker measurements to be reliably mapped during the preclinical phase. Although ADAD represents a small proportion of AD cases, understanding neuroimaging-based changes that occur during the preclinical period may provide insight into early disease stages of ‘sporadic’ AD also. Additionally, this study provides rich data for research in healthy aging through inclusion of the non-carrier controls.

These two techniques are used as biomarkers of both pathology and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and to differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative diseases., MRI is able to identify structural changes including patterns of atrophy characterizing neurodegenerative diseases, and to distinguish these from other causes of cognitive impairment, e.g. infarcts, space-occupying lesions and hydrocephalus., PET is widely used to identify regional patterns of glucose utilization, since distinct patterns of distribution of cerebral glucose metabolism are related to different subtypes of neurodegenerative dementia., The use of PET in mild cognitive impairment, though controversial, is deemed helpful for predicting conversion to dementia and the dementia clinical subtype. Recently, new radiopharmaceuticals for the in vivo imaging of amyloid burden have been licensed and more tracers are being developed for the assessment of tauopathies and inflammatory processes, which may underlie the onset of the amyloid cascade., At present, the cerebral amyloid burden, imaged with PET, may help to exclude the presence of AD as well as forecast its possible onset. Finally PET imaging may be particularly useful in ongoing clinical trials for the development of dementia treatments. In the near future, the use of the above methods, in accordance with specific guidelines, along with the use of effective treatments will likely lead to more timely and successful treatment of neurodegenerative dementias.\n\n【摘要翻译】神经成像，包括磁共振成像（MRI）和正电子发射断层扫描（PET），在原发性神经退行性疾病的诊断中发挥着关键作用。这两种技术被用作阿尔茨海默病（AD）的病理学和进展的生物标志物，并将AD与其他神经退行性疾病区分开来。，MRI能够识别结构变化，包括表征神经退行性疾病的萎缩模式，并将其与认知障碍的其他原因区分开来，例如梗死、占位性病变和脑积水。，PET被广泛用于识别葡萄糖利用的区域模式，因为大脑葡萄糖代谢的不同分布模式与神经退行性痴呆的不同亚型有关。，PET在轻度认知障碍中的应用，尽管有争议，但被认为有助于预测转化为痴呆症和痴呆症临床亚型。最近，用于淀粉样蛋白负荷的体内成像的新的放射性药物已经获得许可，并且正在开发更多的示踪剂来评估tau病和炎症过程，这可能是淀粉样蛋白级联反应的基础。，目前，PET成像的大脑淀粉样蛋白负荷可能有助于排除AD的存在，并预测其可能的发病。最后，PET成像可能在正在进行的痴呆症治疗开发的临床试验中特别有用。在不久的将来，根据具体指南使用上述方法，以及使用有效的治疗方法，可能会使神经退行性痴呆得到更及时、更成功的治疗。",

		"abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease most often associated with memory deficits and cognitive decline, although less common clinical presentations are increasingly recognized. The cardinal pathological features of the disease have been known for more than one hundred years, and today the presence of these amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are still required for a pathological diagnosis. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia globally. There remain no effective treatment options for the great majority of patients, and the primary causes of the disease are unknown except in a small number of familial cases driven by genetic mutations. Confounding efforts to develop effective diagnostic tools and disease-modifying therapies is the realization that Alzheimer’s disease is a mixed proteinopathy (amyloid and tau) frequently associated with other age-related processes such as cerebrovascular disease and Lewy body disease. Defining the relationships between and interdependence of various co-pathologies remains an active area of investigation. This review outlines etiologically-linked pathologic features of Alzheimer’s disease, as well as those that are inevitable findings of uncertain significance, such as granulovacuolar degeneration and Hirano bodies. Other disease processes that are frequent, but not inevitable, are also discussed, including pathologic processes that can clinically mimic Alzheimer’s disease. These include cerebrovascular disease, Lewy body disease, TDP-43 proteinopathies and argyrophilic grain disease. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of Alzheimer’s disease pathology, its defining pathologic substrates and the related pathologies that can affect diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【摘要翻译】阿尔茨海默病是一种进行性神经退行性疾病，通常与记忆缺陷和认知能力下降有关，尽管不太常见的临床表现越来越被认可。这种疾病的主要病理特征已经知道一百多年了，今天，这些淀粉样蛋白斑块和神经原纤维缠结的存在仍然是病理诊断所必需的。阿尔茨海默病是全球痴呆症最常见的病因。对于绝大多数患者来说，仍然没有有效的治疗选择，除了少数由基因突变引起的家族性病例外，这种疾病的主要原因尚不清楚。开发有效诊断工具和疾病改良疗法的努力令人困惑的是，人们意识到阿尔茨海默病是一种混合蛋白病（淀粉样蛋白和tau），经常与其他与年龄相关的过程有关，如脑血管病和路易体病。定义各种共病之间的关系和相互依存性仍然是一个活跃的研究领域。这篇综述概述了阿尔茨海默病的病因相关病理特征，以及那些具有不确定意义的不可避免的发现，如颗粒细胞变性和平野体。还讨论了其他常见但并非不可避免的疾病过程，包括临床上可以模拟阿尔茨海默病的病理过程。其中包括脑血管病、路易体病、TDP-43蛋白病和嗜银性谷物病。这篇综述的目的是概述阿尔茨海默病的病理学、其定义的病理基础以及可能影响诊断和治疗的相关病理学。",

This review provides an overview of the issues involved in a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease before an individual meets the criteria for Alzheimer’s dementia. It examines how Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis rates can be improved, the implications of an early diagnosis for the individual, carer and society, and the importance of risk reduction to prevent or delay progression. Although no disease-modifying agents capable of reversing the initial pathological changes are currently available, it may be possible to prevent or delay the development of dementia in a proportion of the population by modifying exposure to common risk factors. In other individuals, diagnosing the disease or risk of disease early is still valuable so that the individual and their carers have time to make choices and plan for the future, and to allow access to treatments that can help manage symptoms. Primary healthcare professionals play a pivotal role in recognising individuals at risk, recommending lifestyle changes in mid-adult life that can prevent or slow down the disease, and in timely diagnosis. Early intervention is the optimal strategy, because the patient’s level of function is preserved for longer.\n\n【摘要翻译】阿尔茨海默病是痴呆症的主要病因。然而，无论是阿尔茨海默病还是老年痴呆症都不是衰老的必然结果。这篇综述概述了在个人达到阿尔茨海默病痴呆症标准之前诊断阿尔茨海默病所涉及的问题。它研究了如何提高阿尔茨海默病的诊断率，早期诊断对个人、护理人员和社会的影响，以及降低风险对预防或延迟进展的重要性。尽管目前还没有能够逆转最初病理变化的疾病修饰剂，但通过改变对常见风险因素的暴露，可以在一定比例的人群中预防或延缓痴呆症的发展。对其他人来说，早期诊断疾病或疾病风险仍然很有价值，这样个人和他们的护理人员就有时间做出选择和规划未来，并获得有助于控制症状的治疗。初级保健专业人员在识别有风险的个人、建议中年人改变生活方式以预防或减缓疾病以及及时诊断方面发挥着关键作用。早期干预是最佳策略，因为患者的功能水平可以保持更长时间。",

The adversarial loss brought by the discriminator provides a clever way of incorporating unlabeled samples into training and imposing higher order consistency. This has proven to be useful in many cases, such as domain adaptation, data augmentation, and image-to-image translation. These properties have attracted researchers in the medical imaging community, and we have seen rapid adoption in many traditional and novel applications, such as image reconstruction, segmentation, detection, classification, and cross-modality synthesis.

		"abstract": "Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a widely used medical imaging protocol that can be configured to provide different contrasts between the tissues in human body. By setting different scanning parameters, each MR imaging modality reflects the unique visual characteristic of scanned body part, benefiting the subsequent analysis from multiple perspectives. To utilize the complementary information from multiple imaging modalities, cross-modality MR image synthesis has aroused increasing research interest recently. However, most existing methods only focus on minimizing pixel/voxel-wise intensity difference but ignore the textural details of image content structure, which affects the quality of synthesized images. In this paper, we propose edge-aware generative adversarial networks (Ea-GANs) for cross-modality MR image synthesis. Specifically, we integrate edge information, which reflects the textural structure of image content and depicts the boundaries of different objects in images, to reduce this gap. Corresponding to different learning strategies, two frameworks are proposed, i.e., a generator-induced Ea-GAN (gEa-GAN) and a discriminator-induced Ea-GAN (dEa-GAN). The gEa-GAN incorporates the edge information via its generator, while the dEa-GAN further does this from both the generator and the discriminator so that the edge similarity is also adversarially learned. In addition, the proposed Ea-GANs are 3D-based and utilize hierarchical features to capture contextual information. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Ea-GANs, especially the dEa-GAN, outperform multiple state-of-the-art methods for crossmodality MR image synthesis in both qualitative and quantitative measures. Moreover, the dEa-GAN also shows excellent generality to generic image synthesis tasks on benchmark datasets about facades, maps, and cityscapes.\n\n【摘要翻译】磁共振（MR）成像是一种广泛使用的医学成像协议，可以配置为在人体组织之间提供不同的对比度。通过设置不同的扫描参数，每个MR成像模式都反映了被扫描身体部位的独特视觉特征，有利于后续从多个角度进行分析。为了利用多个成像模态的互补信息，跨模态MR图像合成近年来引起了越来越多的研究兴趣。然而，现有的大多数方法只关注最小化像素/体素的强度差异，而忽略了图像内容结构的纹理细节，这影响了合成图像的质量。在本文中，我们提出了用于跨模态MR图像合成的边缘感知生成对抗性网络（Ea-GAN）。具体来说，我们整合了边缘信息，以减少这种差距，边缘信息反映了图像内容的纹理结构，并描绘了图像中不同对象的边界。针对不同的学习策略，提出了两种框架，即生成器诱导的Ea-GAN（gEa-GAN）和鉴别器诱导的Ea-GAN（dEa-GAN）。gEa-GAN通过其生成器合并边缘信息，而dEa-GAN进一步通过生成器和鉴别器合并边缘信息以使边缘相似性也被反向学习。此外，所提出的Ea-GAN是基于3D的，并利用层次特征来捕获上下文信息。实验结果表明，所提出的Ea-GAN，特别是dEa-GAN在定性和定量方面都优于多种最先进的跨模态MR图像合成方法。此外，dEa-GAN还显示出对立面、地图和城市景观基准数据集上的通用图像合成任务的良好通用性。",

		"abstract": "To address the problem of high feature dimensionality of Parkinson’s disease medical data, this paper introduces SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value for feature selection of Parkinson’s disease medical dataset. This paper combines SHAP value with four classiﬁers, namely deep forest (gcForest), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and random forest (RF), respectively. Then this paper applies them to Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. First, the classiﬁer is used to calculate the magnitude of contribution of SHAP value to the features, then the features with signiﬁcant contribution in the classiﬁcation task are selected, and then the data after feature selection is used as input to classify the Parkinson’s disease dataset for diagnosis using the classiﬁer. The experimental results show that compared to Fscore, analysis of variance (Anova-F) and mutual information (MI) feature selection methods, the four models based on SHAP-value feature selection achieved good classiﬁcation results. The SHAP-gcForest model combined with gcForest achieves classiﬁcation accuracy of 91.78% and F1-score of 0.945 when 150 features are selected. The SHAP-LightGBM model combined with LightGBM achieves classiﬁcation accuracy and F1-score of 91.62% and 0.945 when 50 features are selected, respectively. The classiﬁcation effectiveness is second only to the SHAP-gcForest model, but the SHAP-LightGBM model is more computationally efﬁcient than the SHAP-gcForest model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is veriﬁed by comparing it with the results of existing literature. The ﬁndings demonstrate that machine learning with SHAP value feature selection method has good classiﬁcation performance in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, and provides a reference for physicians in the diagnosis and prevention of Parkinson’s disease.

		"abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition distinguished by structural and functional changes to the kidney over time. Studies show that 10% of adults worldwide are affected by some kind of CKD, resulting in 1.2 million deaths. Recently, CKD has emerged as a leading cause of mortality worldwide, making it necessary to develop a Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) system to diagnose CKD automatically. Machine Learning (ML) based CAD system can be used by a clinician to automatically diagnoses mass people. Since ML models are considered a black box, it is also necessary to expose influential causes behind a model's prediction of a particular output. So that, a doctor can make a more rational decision based on the model's output and analysis of the features influence on the model. In this paper, we have used the XGBoost as the ML classifier to predict whether a patient has CKD or not. Using the XGBoost classifier, we have obtained an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of $$99.16{\\%}, 100{\\%}, 98.68{\\%},$$and $$99.33{\\%},$$respectively using all $$24$$features. Furthermore, we have used Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm to find an effective subset of the features. The BBO algorithm selected almost half of the initial features. We have obtained an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of $$98.33{\\%}, 100{\\%}, 97.36{\\%},$$and $$98.67{\\%},$$respectively using only 13 features selected by the BBO algorithm. Finally, we have explained the impact of the feature on the ML models using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Using SHAP analysis and BBO algorithm, we have found that hemoglobin and albumin mostly contribute to the detection of CKD.\n\n【摘要翻译】慢性肾脏疾病（CKD）是一种以肾脏结构和功能随时间变化为特征的疾病。研究表明，全球10%的成年人受到某种CKD的影响，导致120万人死亡。近年来，CKD已成为世界范围内死亡的主要原因，因此有必要开发一种计算机辅助诊断（CAD）系统来自动诊断CKD。临床医生可以使用基于机器学习（ML）的CAD系统来自动诊断大量人群。由于ML模型被认为是一个黑匣子，因此也有必要揭露模型预测特定输出背后的影响因素。因此，医生可以根据模型的输出和分析特征对模型的影响做出更合理的决定。在本文中，我们使用XGBoost作为ML分类器来预测患者是否患有CKD。使用XGBoost分类器，我们使用所有$$24$$特征分别获得了$$99.16、100、98.68、$$和$$99.33、$$的准确度、精确度、召回率和F1分数。此外，我们还使用基于生物地理的优化（BBO）算法来找到特征的有效子集。BBO算法选择了几乎一半的初始特征。我们仅使用BBO算法选择的13个特征，就获得了分别为$98.33、100、97.36、$$和$98.67、$$的准确度、精确度、召回率和F1分数。最后，我们使用SHapley加性规划（SHAP）分析解释了该特征对ML模型的影响。使用SHAP分析和BBO算法，我们发现血红蛋白和白蛋白主要有助于CKD的检测。",

		"abstract": "The demographics of aging suggest a great need for the early diagnosis of dementia and the development of preventive strategies. Neuropathology and structural MRI studies have pointed to the medial temporal lobe (MTL) as the brain region earliest affected in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). MRI findings provide strong evidence that in mild cognitive impairments (MCI), AD-related volume losses can be reproducibly detected in the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex (EC) and, to a lesser extent, the parahippocampal gyrus; they also indicate that lateral temporal lobe changes are becoming increasingly useful in predicting the transition to dementia. Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging has revealed glucose metabolic reductions in the parieto-temporal, frontal and posterior cingulate cortices to be the hallmark of AD. Overall, the pattern of cortical metabolic changes has been useful for the prediction of future AD as well as in distinguishing AD from other neurodegenerative diseases. FDG-PET on average achieves 90% sensitivity in identifying AD, although specificity in differentiating AD from other dementias is lower. Moreover, recent MRI-guided FDG-PET studies have shown that MTL hypometabolism is the most specific and sensitive measure for the identification of MCI, while the utility of cortical deficits is controversial. This review highlights cross-sectional, prediction and longitudinal FDG-PET studies and attempts to put into perspective the value of FDG-PET in diagnosing AD-like changes, particularly at an early stage, and in providing diagnostic specificity. The examination of MTL structures, which has so far been exclusive to MRI protocols, is then examined as a possible strategy to improve diagnostic specificity. All told, there is considerable promise that early and specific diagnosis is feasible through a combination of imaging modalities.\n\n【摘要翻译】老龄化的人口统计数据表明，非常需要对痴呆症进行早期诊断并制定预防策略。神经病理学和结构MRI研究表明，内侧颞叶（MTL）是阿尔茨海默病（AD）最早发病的大脑区域。MRI结果提供了强有力的证据，证明在轻度认知障碍（MCI）中，可以在海马体、内嗅皮层（EC）以及较小程度的海马旁回中重复检测到AD相关的体积损失；他们还表明，侧颞叶的变化在预测向痴呆的转变方面越来越有用。氟-2-脱氧-D-葡萄糖正电子发射断层扫描（FDG-PET）成像显示，顶颞、额和后扣带皮质的葡萄糖代谢减少是AD的标志。总的来说，皮质代谢变化模式有助于预测未来AD，并将AD与其他神经退行性疾病区分开来。FDG-PET在识别AD方面平均达到90%的灵敏度，尽管在区分AD和其他痴呆方面的特异性较低。此外，最近MRI引导的FDG-PET研究表明，MTL低代谢是识别MCI最具体、最敏感的指标，而皮质缺损的实用性仍存在争议。这篇综述重点介绍了FDG-PET的横断面、预测和纵向研究，并试图正确看待FDG-PET在诊断AD样变化（尤其是在早期）和提供诊断特异性方面的价值。到目前为止，MTL结构的检查仅限于MRI协议，然后作为提高诊断特异性的可能策略进行检查。总的来说，通过多种成像模式的结合，早期和特异性诊断是可行的。",

		"abstract": "Background: Changes in the metabolic and structural brain networks in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been widely researched. However, few studies have compared the differences in the topological properties of the metabolic and structural brain networks in patients with MCI.Methods: We analyzedmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data of 137 patients with MCI and 80 healthy controls (HCs). The HC group data comes from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The permutation test was used to compare the network parameters (characteristic path length, clustering coefficient, local efficiency, and global efficiency) between the two groups. Partial Pearson’s correlation analysis was used to calculate the correlations of the changes in gray matter volume and glucose intake in the key brain regions in MCI with the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-cog) sub-item scores.Results: Significant changes in the brain network parameters (longer characteristic path length, larger clustering coefficient, and lower local efficiency and global efficiency) were greater in the structural network than in the metabolic network (longer characteristic path length) in MCI patients than in HCs. We obtained the key brain regions (left globus pallidus, right calcarine fissure and its surrounding cortex, left lingual gyrus) by scanning the hubs. The volume of gray matter atrophy in the left globus pallidus was significantly positively correlated with comprehension of spoken language (p = 0.024) and word-finding difficulty in spontaneous speech item scores (p = 0.007) in the ADAS-cog. Glucose intake in the three key brain regions was significantly negatively correlated with remembering test instructions items in ADAS-cog (p = 0.020, p = 0.014, and p = 0.008, respectively).Conclusion: Structural brain networks showed more changes than metabolic brain networks in patients with MCI. Some brain regions with significant changes in betweenness centrality in both structural and metabolic networks were associated with MCI.\n\n【摘要翻译】背景：轻度认知障碍（MCI）患者大脑代谢和结构网络的变化已被广泛研究。然而，很少有研究比较MCI患者代谢和结构脑网络拓扑特性的差异。方法：我们分析了137名MCI患者和80名健康对照（HC）的磁共振成像（MRI）和氟脱氧葡萄糖正电子发射断层扫描（FDG-PET）数据。HC组的数据来自阿尔茨海默病神经成像倡议（ADNI）数据库。使用排列测试来比较两组之间的网络参数（特征路径长度、聚类系数、局部效率和全局效率）。采用部分Pearson相关分析法计算MCI中大脑关键区域灰质体积和葡萄糖摄入量的变化与阿尔茨海默病评估量表认知（ADAS-cog）分项得分的相关性MCI患者的结构网络中（特征路径长度较长，聚类系数较大，局部效率和全局效率较低）大于代谢网络中（特性路径长度较长）。我们通过扫描中枢获得了大脑的关键区域（左侧苍白球、右侧钙绿色裂及其周围皮层、左侧舌回）。在ADAS-cog中，左侧苍白球的灰质萎缩量与口语理解（p=0.024）和自发言语项目得分中的单词发现困难（p=0.007）显著正相关。大脑三个关键区域的葡萄糖摄入量与ADAS-cog中记忆测试指令项目呈显著负相关（分别为p=0.020、p=0.014和p=0.008）。结论：MCI患者的结构脑网络比代谢脑网络显示出更多的变化。一些在结构和代谢网络中介数中心性发生显著变化的大脑区域与MCI有关。",

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and represents the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. For AD, disease-modifying treatments are presently lacking, and the understanding of disease mechanisms continues to be incomplete. In the present review, we discuss candidate contributing factors leading to AD, and evaluate novel computational brain simulation methods to further disentangle their potential roles. We first present an overview of existing computational models for AD that aim to provide a mechanistic understanding of the disease. Next, we outline the potential to link molecular aspects of neurodegeneration in AD with large-scale brain network modeling using The Virtual Brain (www.thevirtualbrain.org), an open-source, multiscale, whole-brain simulation neuroinformatics platform. Finally, we discuss how this methodological approach may contribute to the understanding, improved diagnostics, and treatment optimization of AD.\n\n【摘要翻译】尽管近年来神经科学的知识和数据积累加速，但高度流行的AD神经退行性疾病仍然是一个日益严重的问题。阿尔茨海默病（AD）是痴呆症最常见的病因，也是最常见的神经退行性疾病。对于AD，目前缺乏改变疾病的治疗方法，对疾病机制的了解仍然不完整。在这篇综述中，我们讨论了导致AD的候选因素，并评估了新的计算大脑模拟方法，以进一步理清它们的潜在作用。我们首先概述了现有的AD计算模型，旨在提供对该疾病的机制理解。接下来，我们概述了使用开源、多尺度、全脑模拟神经信息学平台the Virtual brain（www.thevirtualbrain.org）将AD神经退行性变的分子方面与大规模脑网络建模联系起来的潜力。最后，我们讨论了这种方法论方法如何有助于理解、改进AD的诊断和治疗优化。",

		"abstract": "The present paper has studied the corrosion inhibition property of Juglone extracted from walnut (Juglans regia L.) green husk for mild steel samples exposed to an acid electrolyte (1 M HCl). Besides, via computer modelings, the attraction forces of the inhibitors/metal surface were explored. The corrosion inhibition efﬁciency of the organic inhibitor was evaluated using potentiodynamic polarization as well as EIS techniques. In addition, XPS, FT-IR, SEM, AFM, and UV–visible spectroscopy have been used to study the inhibition mechanism of the agricultural waste extract in the corrosive media. Quantum chemical calculations based on DFT theory and molecular dynamic simulations were investigated on the adsorbed Juglone inhibitors. The obtained results indicated that the efﬁciency of the used inhibitor was enhanced with increasing the concentration of green corrosion inhibitor (GCI) and reached 95% in the presence of 800 ppm after 8 h immersion. Moreover, the average roughness of the exposed metal to the corrosive electrolyte decreased from 68.2 ± 8.3 nm for the blank solution to 3.4 ± 0.3 nm for the solution containing 800 ppm GCI. Furthermore, the Tafel extrapolated polarization results revealed that the extracted GCI functioned as a mixed-type corrosion inhibitor. Finally, the obtained analysis results are supported by theoretical data.\n\n【摘要翻译】本文研究了从核桃（Juglans regia L.）绿壳中提取的胡桃酮对酸性电解液（1M HCl）中软钢样品的缓蚀性能。此外，通过计算机建模，探索了抑制剂/金属表面的吸引力。使用动电位极化和EIS技术评估了有机抑制剂的缓蚀效果。此外，还利用XPS、FT-IR、SEM、AFM和紫外可见光谱研究了农业废弃物提取物在腐蚀介质中的抑制机理。基于DFT理论和分子动力学模拟对Juglone抑制剂的吸附进行了量子化学计算。所得结果表明，所用缓蚀剂的效率随着绿色缓蚀剂（GCI）浓度的增加而提高，在800 ppm的存在下，浸泡8小时后达到95%。此外，暴露于腐蚀性电解质的金属的平均粗糙度从空白溶液的68.2±8.3nm降低到含有800ppm GCI的溶液的3.4±0.3nm。此外，Tafel外推极化结果表明，提取的GCI具有混合型缓蚀剂的作用。最后，得到的分析结果得到了理论数据的支持。",

		"abstract": "Comparing the brains of related species faces the challenges of establishing homologies whilst accommodating evolutionary specializations. Here we propose a general framework for understanding similarities and differences between the brains of primates. The approach uses white matter blueprints of the whole cortex based on a set of white matter tracts that can be anatomically matched across species. The blueprints provide a common reference space that allows us to navigate between brains of different species, identify homologous cortical areas, or to transform whole cortical maps from one species to the other. Specializations are cast within this framework as deviations between the species’ blueprints. We illustrate how this approach can be used to compare human and macaque brains.\n\n【摘要翻译】比较相关物种的大脑面临着在适应进化专业化的同时建立同源性的挑战。在这里，我们提出了一个理解灵长类动物大脑异同的通用框架。该方法使用了基于一组白质束的整个皮层的白质蓝图，这些白质束可以在不同物种之间进行解剖学匹配。蓝图提供了一个共同的参考空间，使我们能够在不同物种的大脑之间导航，识别同源皮层区域，或将整个皮层地图从一个物种转换到另一个物种。在这个框架内，专业化被视为物种蓝图之间的偏差。我们展示了如何使用这种方法来比较人类和猕猴的大脑。",

		"abstract": "How the evolution of speech has transformed the human auditory cortex compared to other primates remains largely unknown. While primary auditory cortex is organized largely similarly in humans and macaques,1 the picture is much less clear at higher levels of the anterior auditory pathway,2 particularly regarding the processing of conspecific vocalizations (CVs). A “voice region” similar to the human voice-selective areas3,4 has been identified in the macaque right anterior temporal lobe with functional MRI;5 however, its anatomical localization, seemingly inconsistent with that of the human temporal voice areas (TVAs), has suggested a “repositioning of the voice area” in recent human evolution.6 Here we report a functional homology in the cerebral processing of vocalizations by macaques and humans, using comparative fMRI and a condition-rich auditory stimulation paradigm. We find that the anterior temporal lobe of both species possesses cortical voice areas that are bilateral and not only prefer conspecific vocalizations but also implement a representational geometry categorizing them apart from all other sounds in a species-specific but homologous manner. These results reveal a more similar functional organization of higher-level auditory cortex in macaques and humans than currently known.\n\n【摘要翻译】与其他灵长类动物相比，言语的进化是如何改变人类听觉皮层的，这在很大程度上是未知的。虽然人类和猕猴的初级听觉皮层组织基本相似，1但在前听觉通路的较高水平上，情况就不那么清楚了，2尤其是在同种发声（CV）的处理方面。功能性MRI在猕猴右前颞叶发现了一个类似于人声选择区3、4的“声音区”；5然而，它的解剖定位似乎与人类颞音区（TVA）的解剖定位不一致，这表明在最近的人类进化中“音区的重新定位”。6在这里，我们使用比较功能磁共振成像和条件丰富的听觉刺激范式，报告了猕猴和人类在大脑发声过程中的功能同源性。我们发现，这两个物种的前颞叶都有双侧的皮层发声区域，不仅喜欢同种发声，而且实现了一种代表性的几何结构，以物种特异但同源的方式将它们与所有其他声音区分开来。这些结果揭示了猕猴和人类高级听觉皮层的功能组织比目前已知的更相似。",

		"abstract": "Resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) may provide a powerful and noninvasive “bridge” for comparing brain function between patients and experimental animal models; however, the relationship between human and macaque rs-fcMRI remains poorly understood. Here, using a novel surface deformation process for species comparisons in the same anatomical space (, ), we found high correspondence, but also unique hub topology, between human and macaque functional connectomes. The global functional connectivity match between species was moderate to strong (r = 0.41) and increased when considering the top 15% strongest connections (r = 0.54). Analysis of the match between functional connectivity and the underlying anatomical connectivity, derived from a previous retrograde tracer study done in macaques (), showed impressive structure–function correspondence in both the macaque and human. When examining the strongest structural connections, we found a 70–80% match between structural and functional connectivity matrices in both species. Finally, we compare species on two widely used metrics for studying hub topology: degree and betweenness centrality. The data showed topological agreement across the species, with nodes of the posterior cingulate showing high degree and betweenness centrality. In contrast, nodes in medial frontal and parietal cortices were identified as having high degree and betweenness in the human as opposed to the macaque. Our results provide: (1) a thorough examination and validation for a surface-based interspecies deformation process, (2) a strong theoretical foundation for making interspecies comparisons of rs-fcMRI, and (3) a unique look at topological distinctions between the species.\n\n【摘要翻译】静息状态功能连接MRI（rs-fcMRI）可以为比较患者和实验动物模型之间的大脑功能提供一个强大且无创的“桥梁”；然而，人类和猕猴的fcMRI之间的关系仍然知之甚少。在这里，使用一种新的表面变形过程在同一解剖空间中进行物种比较（，），我们发现人类和猕猴功能连接体之间具有高度的对应性，但也具有独特的中枢拓扑结构。物种之间的整体功能连接匹配是中等到强烈的（r=0.41），当考虑到前15%的最强连接时（r=0.54），这种匹配会增加。对功能连接和潜在解剖连接之间匹配的分析，源于之前对猕猴进行的逆行示踪研究（），在猕猴和人类身上都显示出令人印象深刻的结构-功能对应关系。在研究最强的结构连接时，我们发现两个物种的结构和功能连接矩阵之间有70-80%的匹配。最后，我们在研究集线器拓扑的两个广泛使用的指标上比较了物种：度和介数中心性。数据显示，整个物种的拓扑一致，后扣带的节点显示出高度和介数中心性。相反，与猕猴相比，人类额叶和顶叶内侧皮质的结节具有高度和介数性。我们的结果提供了：（1）对基于表面的种间变形过程进行了彻底的检查和验证，（2）为进行rs-fcMRI的种间比较提供了强有力的理论基础，以及（3）对物种之间拓扑差异的独特见解。",

To take up this challenge, we build on DeepLabCut, an open-source pose estimation toolbox, and provide high-performance animal assembly and tracking—features required for multi-animal scenarios. Furthermore, we integrate the ability to predict an animal’s identity to assist tracking (in case of occlusions). We illustrate the power of this framework with four datasets varying in complexity, which we release to serve as a benchmark for future algorithm development.\n\n【摘要翻译】摘要估计多只动物的姿势是一个具有挑战性的计算机视觉问题：频繁的互动会导致遮挡，并使检测到的关键点与正确个体的关联复杂化，此外，与典型的多人场景相比，长相高度相似的动物互动更紧密。为了应对这一挑战，我们在开源姿势估计工具箱DeepLabCut的基础上进行了构建，并提供了高性能的动物组装和跟踪——这是多动物场景所需的功能。此外，我们整合了预测动物身份的能力，以帮助跟踪（在闭塞的情况下）。我们用四个复杂度不同的数据集来说明这个框架的威力，我们发布这些数据集是为了作为未来算法开发的基准。",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            The desire to understand how the brain generates and patterns behavior has driven rapid methodological innovation in tools to quantify natural animal behavior. While advances in deep learning and computer vision have enabled markerless pose estimation in individual animals, extending these to multiple animals presents unique challenges for studies of social behaviors or animals in their natural environments. Here we present Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses (SLEAP), a machine learning system for multi-animal pose tracking. This system enables versatile workflows for data labeling, model training and inference on previously unseen data. SLEAP features an accessible graphical user interface, a standardized data model, a reproducible configuration system, over 30 model architectures, two approaches to part grouping and two approaches to identity tracking. We applied SLEAP to seven datasets across flies, bees, mice and gerbils to systematically evaluate each approach and architecture, and we compare it with other existing approaches. SLEAP achieves greater accuracy and speeds of more than 800 frames per second, with latencies of less than 3.5 ms at full 1,024 × 1,024 image resolution. This makes SLEAP usable for real-time applications, which we demonstrate by controlling the behavior of one animal on the basis of the tracking and detection of social interactions with another animal.\n\n【摘要翻译】摘要了解大脑如何产生和模式行为的愿望推动了量化自然动物行为工具的快速方法创新。虽然深度学习和计算机视觉的进步使单个动物的姿势估计变得无标记，但将其扩展到多个动物，对研究自然环境中的社会行为或动物提出了独特的挑战。在这里，我们介绍了Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses（SLEAP），这是一个用于多动物姿势跟踪的机器学习系统。该系统实现了对以前看不见的数据进行数据标记、模型训练和推理的多功能工作流程。SLEAP具有可访问的图形用户界面、标准化数据模型、可复制的配置系统、30多种模型架构、两种零件分组方法和两种身份跟踪方法。我们将SLEAP应用于苍蝇、蜜蜂、老鼠和沙鼠的七个数据集，以系统地评估每种方法和架构，并将其与其他现有方法进行比较。SLEAP实现了更高的精度和每秒800帧以上的速度，延迟小于3.5 满1024毫秒 × 1024图像分辨率。这使得SLEAP可用于实时应用，我们通过在跟踪和检测与另一只动物的社交互动的基础上控制一只动物，来证明这一点。",

		"abstract": "The rhesus macaque is an important model species in several branches of science, including neuroscience, psychology, ethology, and medicine. The utility of the macaque model would be greatly enhanced by the ability to precisely measure behavior in freely moving conditions. Existing approaches do not provide sufficient tracking. Here, we describe OpenMonkeyStudio, a deep learning-based markerless motion capture system for estimating 3D pose in freely moving macaques in large unconstrained environments. Our system makes use of 62 machine vision cameras that encircle an open 2.45 m × 2.45 m × 2.75 m enclosure. The resulting multiview image streams allow for data augmentation via 3D-reconstruction of annotated images to train a robust view-invariant deep neural network. This view invariance represents an important advance over previous markerless 2D tracking approaches, and allows fully automatic pose inference on unconstrained natural motion. We show that OpenMonkeyStudio can be used to accurately recognize actions and track social interactions.\n\n【摘要翻译】恒河猴是神经科学、心理学、行为学和医学等多个学科的重要模式物种。猕猴模型在自由移动条件下精确测量行为的能力将大大增强其实用性。现有的方法没有提供足够的跟踪。在这里，我们描述了OpenMonkeyStudio，这是一个基于深度学习的无标记运动捕捉系统，用于估计大型无约束环境中自由移动猕猴的3D姿势。我们的系统使用了62台机器视觉摄像机，它们包围着一个2.45的开口 m × 2.45 m × 2.75 m外壳。所得到的多视点图像流允许通过注释图像的3D重建来增强数据，以训练鲁棒的视点不变深度神经网络。这种视图不变性代表了对以前的无标记2D跟踪方法的重要进步，并允许对无约束自然运动进行全自动姿态推断。我们展示了OpenMonkeyStudio可以用于准确识别动作和跟踪社交互动。",

These tools overcome long-standing limitations of manual scoring of video frames and traditional ‘center of mass’ tracking algorithms to enable video analysis at scale. The expansion of open-source tools for video acquisition and analysis has led to new experimental approaches to understand behavior. Here, we review currently available open-source tools for video analysis and discuss how to set up these methods for labs new to video recording. We also discuss best practices for developing and using video analysis methods, including community-wide standards and critical needs for the open sharing of datasets and code, more widespread comparisons of video analysis methods, and better documentation for these methods especially for new users. We encourage broader adoption and continued development of these tools, which have tremendous potential for accelerating scientific progress in understanding the brain and behavior.\n\n【摘要翻译】最近开发的视频分析方法，特别是姿势估计和行为分类模型，正在将行为量化转变为在神经科学和行为学等领域更加精确、可扩展和可重复。这些工具克服了视频帧手动评分和传统的“质心”跟踪算法的长期局限性，实现了视频的大规模分析。用于视频采集和分析的开源工具的扩展导致了理解行为的新实验方法。在这里，我们回顾了目前可用的视频分析开源工具，并讨论了如何为视频记录新手实验室设置这些方法。我们还讨论了开发和使用视频分析方法的最佳实践，包括社区范围的标准和开放共享数据集和代码的关键需求，更广泛地比较视频分析方法，以及更好地记录这些方法，特别是为新用户记录。我们鼓励更广泛地采用和继续开发这些工具，这些工具在加速理解大脑和行为方面的科学进步方面具有巨大潜力。",

		"abstract": "Objective: At present, the most important cross-species research method is to construct a homologous brain area control map based on the existing homologous sites. However, with the development of the individual, the cerebral cortex will expand irregularly, which affects the existing homologous sites on the individual. Based on this, a method of tracing white matter fiber bundles as a reference frame at the individual level was proposed to construct the connectivity fingerprints of human and macaque brain regions. Materials and Methods: A total of 10 human subjects and 10 rhesus monkey subjects were selected from open brain imaging data set. White matter fiber tracts were extracted from preprocessed data at individual level, the connection strength between brain regions and white matter fiber tracts was calculated, and the connectivity finger pattern was constructed. The kronbach α coefficient was used to calculate the consistency between individuals within species. The cosine-similarity was used to analyze the connectivity patterns of homologous brain regions of two species, and the results were verified by permutation test. Results: Within species, Broca's area (Broca44), Primary sensory area (S1), and Hippocampus (Hippoc)'s consistency coefficients were 0.636, 0.780, 0.977 in macaques, and in humans, the consistency coefficients were 0.781, 0.726, and 0.607. Among species, the cosine similarity calculation results of Broca44 area, S1 area, and Hippoc area were 0.979, 0.994, and 0.995. Conclusions: Tracing white matter fiber tracts at the individual level and constructing connectivity fingerprints for cross-species research between humans and macaques is effective, and this result supports the construction of a cross-species comparison framework between humans and macaques.",

		"abstract": "‘Normal aging’ in the brain refers to age-related changes that occur independent of disease, in particular Alzheimer’s disease. A major barrier to mapping normal brain aging has been the difficulty in excluding the earliest preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, before addressing this issue we first imaged a mouse model and learn that the best MRI measure of dendritic spine loss, a known pathophysiological driver of normal aging, is one that relies on the combined use of functional and structural MRI. In the primary study, we then deployed the combined functional-structural MRI measure to investigate over 100 cognitively-normal people from 20–72 years of age. Next, to cover the tail end of aging, in secondary analyses we investigated structural MRI acquired from cognitively-normal people, 60–84 years of age, who were Alzheimer’s-free via biomarkers. Collectively, the results from the primary functional-structural study, and the secondary structural studies revealed that the dentate gyrus is a hippocampal region differentially affected by aging, and that the entorhinal cortex is a region most resistant to aging. Across the cortex, the primary functional-structural study revealed and that the inferior frontal gyrus is differentially affected by aging, however, the secondary structural studies implicated other frontal cortex regions. Together, the results clarify how normal aging may affect the brain and has possible mechanistic and therapeutic implications.\n\n【摘要翻译】大脑中的“正常衰老”是指与年龄相关的变化，这些变化与疾病无关，尤其是阿尔茨海默病。绘制正常大脑衰老图的一个主要障碍是难以排除阿尔茨海默病的最早临床前阶段。在这里，在解决这个问题之前，我们首先对小鼠模型进行了成像，并了解到树突棘丢失（一种已知的正常衰老的病理生理驱动因素）的最佳MRI测量方法是依赖于功能和结构MRI的联合使用。在初步研究中，我们采用了功能-结构组合MRI测量方法，对100多名20-72岁的认知正常人进行了调查。接下来，为了涵盖衰老的末端，在二次分析中，我们研究了通过生物标志物从60-84岁的认知正常人身上获得的结构MRI，这些人没有阿尔茨海默氏症。总的来说，初级功能结构研究和次级结构研究的结果表明，齿状回是一个受衰老影响不同的海马区域，内嗅皮层是最耐衰老的区域。在整个皮层中，初级功能结构研究揭示了额下回受衰老的不同影响，然而，次级结构研究涉及其他额叶皮层区域。总之，这些结果阐明了正常衰老如何影响大脑，并可能具有机制和治疗意义。",

		"abstract": "Normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cause profound changes in the brain’s structure and function. AD in particular is accompanied by widespread cortical neuronal loss, and loss of connections between brain systems. This degeneration of neural pathways disrupts the functional coherence of brain activation. Recent innovations in brain imaging have detected characteristic disruptions in functional networks. Here we review studies examining changes in functional connectivity, measured through fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), starting with healthy aging and then Alzheimer’s disease. We cover studies that employ the three primary methods to analyze functional connectivity—seed-based, ICA (independent components analysis), and graph theory. At the end we include a brief discussion of other methodologies, such as EEG (electroencephalography), MEG (magnetoencephalography), and PET (positron emission tomography). We also describe multi-modal studies that combine rsfMRI (resting state fMRI) with PET imaging, as well as studies examining the effects of medications. Overall, connectivity and network integrity appear to decrease in healthy aging, but this decrease is accelerated in AD, with specific systems hit hardest, such as the default mode network (DMN). Functional connectivity is a relatively new topic of research, but it holds great promise in revealing how brain network dynamics change across the lifespan and in disease.\n\n【摘要翻译】正常衰老和阿尔茨海默病（AD）会导致大脑结构和功能发生深刻变化。AD尤其伴随着广泛的皮层神经元损失，以及大脑系统之间的连接丧失。这种神经通路的退化破坏了大脑激活的功能连贯性。最近在大脑成像方面的创新发现了功能网络中的特征性破坏。在这里，我们回顾了通过功能磁共振成像（fMRI）测量的功能连接变化的研究，从健康衰老开始，然后是阿尔茨海默病。我们涵盖了使用三种主要方法来分析函数连通性的研究——基于种子的、ICA（独立分量分析）和图论。最后，我们简要讨论了其他方法，如脑电图（EEG）、脑磁图（MEG）和正电子发射断层扫描（PET）。我们还描述了将rsfMRI（静息状态fMRI）与PET成像相结合的多模式研究，以及检查药物效果的研究。总体而言，连接和网络完整性似乎在健康老化中下降，但这种下降在AD中加速，特定系统受到的打击最为严重，如默认模式网络（DMN）。功能连接是一个相对较新的研究课题，但它在揭示大脑网络动力学在寿命和疾病中的变化方面有很大的前景。",

		"abstract": "Working memory, a fundamental cognitive function that is highly dependent on the integrity of the prefrontal cortex, is known to show age-related decline across the typical healthy adult lifespan. Moreover, we know from work in neurophysiology that the prefrontal cortex is disproportionately susceptibly to the pathological effects of aging. The n-back task is arguably the most ubiquitous cognitive task for investigating working memory performance. Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies examine brain regions engaged during performance of the n-back task in adults. The current meta-analyses are the first to examine concordance and age-related changes across the healthy adult lifespan in brain areas engaged when performing the n-back task. We compile data from eligible fMRI articles that report stereotaxic coordinates of brain activity from healthy adults in three age-groups: young (23.57 ± 5.63 years), middle-aged (38.13 ± 5.63 years) and older (66.86 ± 5.70 years) adults. Findings show that the three groups share concordance in the engagement of parietal and cingulate cortices, which have been consistently identified as core areas involved in working memory; as well as the insula, claustrum, and cerebellum, which have not been highlighted as areas involved in working memory. Critically, prefrontal cortex engagement is concordant for young, to a lesser degree for middle-aged adults, and absent in older adults, suggesting a gradual linear decline in concordance of prefrontal cortex engagement. Our results provide important new knowledge for improving methodology and theories of cognition across the lifespan.\n\n【摘要翻译】工作记忆是一种基本的认知功能，高度依赖于前额叶皮层的完整性，众所周知，在典型的健康成年人寿命中，工作记忆会随着年龄的增长而下降。此外，我们从神经生理学的研究中知道，前额叶皮层对衰老的病理影响的敏感性不成比例。n-back任务可以说是研究工作记忆表现的最普遍的认知任务。许多功能性磁共振成像（fMRI）研究检查了成年人在执行n-back任务时参与的大脑区域。目前的荟萃分析首次检验了健康成年人在执行n背任务时大脑区域的一致性和与年龄相关的变化。我们收集了符合条件的fMRI文章中的数据，这些文章报告了三个年龄组的健康成年人大脑活动的立体定位坐标：年轻人（23.57 ± 5.63岁），中年（38.13岁 ± 5.63岁）及以上（66.86 ± 5.70岁）成年人。研究结果表明，这三组人在顶叶和扣带皮层的参与方面具有一致性，这两个区域一直被认为是工作记忆的核心区域；以及脑岛、幽闭和小脑，它们尚未被强调为与工作记忆有关的区域。至关重要的是，年轻人的前额叶皮层参与是一致的，中年人的程度较低，老年人则没有，这表明前额叶皮层的参与一致性逐渐线性下降。我们的研究结果为改进整个生命周期的认知方法和理论提供了重要的新知识。",

		"abstract": "Brain aging and associated neurodegeneration constitute a major societal challenge as well as one for the neuroimaging community. A full understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration still eludes medical researchers, fuelling the development of in vivo neuroimaging markers. Hence it is increasingly recognized that our understanding of neurodegenerative processes likely will depend upon the available information provided by imaging techniques. At the same time, the imaging techniques are often developed in response to the desire to observe certain physiological processes. In this context, functional MRI (fMRI), which has for decades provided information on neuronal activity, has evolved into a large family of techniques well suited for in vivo observations of brain physiology. Given the rapid technical advances in fMRI in recent years, this review aims to summarize the physiological basis of fMRI observations in healthy aging as well as in age-related neurodegeneration. This review focuses on in-vivo human brain imaging studies in this review and on disease features that can be imaged using fMRI methods. In addition to providing detailed literature summaries, this review also discusses future directions in the study of brain physiology using fMRI in the clinical setting.\n\n【摘要翻译】大脑老化和相关的神经退行性变是一个重大的社会挑战，也是神经影像学界面临的挑战。医学研究人员仍然无法充分了解神经退行性变的生理机制，这推动了体内神经成像标记物的开发。因此，人们越来越认识到，我们对神经退行性过程的理解可能取决于成像技术提供的可用信息。同时，成像技术通常是根据观察某些生理过程的愿望而开发的。在这种情况下，几十年来一直提供神经元活动信息的功能性MRI（fMRI）已经发展成为一大类技术，非常适合于大脑生理学的体内观察。鉴于近年来功能磁共振成像技术的快速发展，本综述旨在总结功能磁共振在健康衰老和年龄相关神经退行性变中观察的生理基础。这篇综述的重点是体内人脑成像研究，以及可以使用功能磁共振成像方法成像的疾病特征。除了提供详细的文献摘要外，这篇综述还讨论了在临床环境中使用fMRI研究大脑生理学的未来方向。",

		"abstract": "Surface-based morphometry (SBM) is extremely useful for estimating the indices of cortical morphology, such as volume, thickness, area, and gyrification, whereas voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a typical method of gray matter (GM) volumetry that includes cortex measurement. In cases where SBM is used to estimate cortical morphology, it remains controversial as to whether VBM should be used in addition to estimate GM volume. Therefore, this review has two main goals. First, we summarize the differences between the two methods regarding preprocessing, statistical analysis, and reliability. Second, we review studies that estimate cortical morphological changes using VBM and/or SBM and discuss whether using VBM in conjunction with SBM produces additional values. We found cases in which detection of morphological change in either VBM or SBM was superior, and others that showed equivalent performance between the two methods. Therefore, we concluded that using VBM and SBM together can help researchers and clinicians obtain a better understanding of normal neurobiological processes of the brain. Moreover, the use of both methods may improve the accuracy of the detection of morphological changes when comparing the data of patients and controls.In addition, we introduce two other recent methods as future directions for estimating cortical morphological changes: a multi-modal parcellation method using structural and functional images, and a synthetic segmentation method using multi-contrast images (such as T1- and proton density-weighted images).\n\n【摘要翻译】基于表面的形态计量学（SBM）对于估计皮层形态的指标（如体积、厚度、面积和回转）非常有用，而基于体素的形态计量术（VBM）是一种典型的灰质（GM）体积测量方法，包括皮层测量。在SBM用于估计皮层形态的情况下，除了估计GM体积外，是否还应使用VBM仍存在争议。因此，本次审查有两个主要目标。首先，我们总结了两种方法在预处理、统计分析和可靠性方面的差异。其次，我们回顾了使用VBM和/或SBM估计皮层形态学变化的研究，并讨论了将VBM与SBM结合使用是否会产生额外的值。我们发现，在VBM或SBM中，对形态学变化的检测效果更好，而在其他情况下，这两种方法的性能相当。因此，我们得出结论，将VBM和SBM结合使用可以帮助研究人员和临床医生更好地了解大脑的正常神经生物学过程。此外，在比较患者和对照组的数据时，使用这两种方法可以提高形态学变化检测的准确性。此外，我们还介绍了另外两种最新的方法作为估计皮层形态变化的未来方向：一种是使用结构和功能图像的多模态分割方法，另一种是利用多对比度图像（如T1和质子密度加权图像）的合成分割方法。",

		"abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the fourth most common neurodevelopmental disorder, with a prevalence of 1 in 160 children. Accurate diagnosis relies on experts, but such individuals are scarce. This has led to increasing interest in the development of machine learning (ML) models that can integrate neuroimaging features from functional and structural MRI (fMRI and sMRI) to help reveal central nervous system alterations characteristic of ASD. We optimized and compared the performance of 12 of the most popular and powerful ML models. Each was separately trained using 15 different combinations of fMRI and sMRI features and optimized with an unbiased model search. Deep learning models predicted ASD with the highest diagnostic accuracy and generalized well to other MRI datasets. Our model achieves state-of-the-art 80% area under the ROC curve (AUROC) in diagnosis on test data from the IMPAC dataset; and 86% and 79% AUROC on the external ABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets (with further improvement to 93% and 90% after supervised domain adaptation). The highest performing models identified reproducible putative biomarkers for accurate ASD diagnosis in accord with known ASD markers as well as novel cerebellar biomarkers. Such reproducibility lends credence to their tremendous potential for defining and using a set of truly generalizable ASD biomarkers that will advance scientific understanding of neuronal changes in ASD.",

		"abstract": "Over the past decade, in-vivo MRI studies have provided many invaluable insights into the neural substrates underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is now known to be associated with neurodevelopmental variations in brain anatomy, functioning, and connectivity. These systems-level features of ASD pathology seem to develop differentially across the human lifespan so that the cortical abnormalities that occur in children with ASD differ from those noted at other stages of life. Thus, investigation of the brain in ASD poses particular methodological challenges, which must be addressed to enable the comparison of results across studies. Novel analytical approaches are also being developed to facilitate the translation of findings from the research to the clinical setting. In the future, the insights provided by human neuroimaging studies could contribute to biomarker development for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders, and to new approaches to diagnosis and treatment.",

		"abstract": "Animal behavior usually has a hierarchical structure and dynamics. Therefore, to understand how the neural system coordinates with behaviors, neuroscientists need a quantitative description of the hierarchical dynamics of different behaviors. However, the recent end-to-end machine-learning-based methods for behavior analysis mostly focus on recognizing behavioral identities on a static timescale or based on limited observations. These approaches usually lose rich dynamic information on cross-scale behaviors. Here, inspired by the natural structure of animal behaviors, we address this challenge by proposing a parallel and multi-layered framework to learn the hierarchical dynamics and generate an objective metric to map the behavior into the feature space. In addition, we characterize the animal 3D kinematics with our low-cost and efficient multi-view 3D animal motion-capture system. Finally, we demonstrate that this framework can monitor spontaneous behavior and automatically identify the behavioral phenotypes of the transgenic animal disease model. The extensive experiment results suggest that our framework has a wide range of applications, including animal disease model phenotyping and the relationships modeling between the neural circuits and behavior., Animal behavior usually has a hierarchical structure and dynamics. Here, the authors propose a parallel and multi-layered framework to learn the hierarchical dynamics and generate an objective metric to map the behaviour into the feature space.\n\n【摘要翻译】动物行为通常具有层次结构和动态。因此，为了理解神经系统如何与行为协调，神经科学家需要对不同行为的层次动态进行定量描述。然而，最近用于行为分析的端到端machine-learning-based方法大多侧重于在静态时间尺度上或基于有限的观察来识别行为身份。这些方法通常会丢失跨尺度行为的丰富动态信息。在这里，受动物行为的自然结构的启发，我们通过提出一个并行和多层框架来学习层次动态并生成一个客观指标来将行为映射到需求空间来应对这一挑战。此外，我们通过我们的低成本和高效的多视图3D动物运动捕捉系统来表征动物3D运动学。最后，我们证明该框架可以监控自发行为并自动识别转基因动物疾病模型的行为表型。大量的实验结果表明，我们的框架具有广泛的应用，包括动物疾病模型表型和神经回路与行为之间的关系建模。，动物行为通常具有层次结构和动力学。在这里，作者提出了一个并行和多层框架来学习层次动力学，并生成一个客观指标来将行为映射到需求空间。",

Standardization can facilitate consistency and transparency with respect to orientation, resolution, labeling scheme, file storage format, and coordinate space designation. Our group has worked to consolidate an extensive selection of popular human brain atlases into a single, curated, open-source library, where they are stored following a standardized protocol with accompanying metadata, which can serve as the basis for future atlases.

		"abstract": "阿尔茨海默症(Alzheimer disease,AD),亦称老年性痴呆,是一种高发于老年人且不易被察觉的慢性神经系统退行性疾病。阿尔茨海默症的病情发展一般分为主观认知功能障碍(subjective cognitive impairment,SCI)、轻度认知功能障碍(mild cognitive impairment,MCI)和AD等3个主要阶段。其中,SCI是正常老年人的脑老化阶段,但未达病理程度。MCI为发生在AD临床前期的一种综合症,同时也是AD发病的早期信号。由于阿尔茨海默症发病缓慢且目前仍无法被完全治愈,因此在实际的临床应用中,早期发现并正确区分出MCI和AD人群,给予他们有效的干预治疗,对于预防或延缓阿尔茨海默症的发生具有重要的意义。在AD的临床诊断中,医生首先会根据患者的个人信息、病史和神经心理学评估等基本信息数据初步判定患者的患病情况,接着根据多种痴呆评定量表结果进一步评估患者AD的严重程度,最后基于患者的临床表现、基因检查数据、影像学检查数据等辅助确诊AD的类型(MCI或AD)。由此可见,要确诊患者是否患有AD,需要医生根据临床经验对大量的医疗病理数据进行分析,如果能使用人工智能技术来辅助诊断,那么对于AD诊断的效率和准确度的提升都会有所帮助。本文基于深度学习技术对阿尔茨海默症的临床分类诊断进行研究,分别提出了基于MRI影像表现文本报告的阿尔茨海默症临床分类模型和基于多次AD临床检查数据的阿尔茨海默症病情发展预测模型,设计实现了基于这些模型的阿尔茨海默症临床医疗辅助诊断系统。本文主要的研究内容包括以下三部分:首先,本文提出了一种基于MRI影像表现文本报告的阿尔茨海默症临床分类诊断方法。该方法利用某三甲医院的AD患者MRI影像表现文本报告作为训练数据,通过分层双向长短期记忆网络(Hierarchical Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory,分层BI-LSTM)和注意力机制Attention的组合构建了分类模型,实现了对阿尔茨海默症的临床分类诊断。其次,本文提出了一种基于多次AD临床检查数据的阿尔茨海默症病情发展预测方法。该方法利用ADNI公共数据集(The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative,ADNI)的数据,将患者一年内至少三次的AD临床检查数据作为输入数据,其中有患者的基本信息数据(包括年龄、性别、教...",

Medical image understanding is generally performed by skilled medical professionals. However, the scarce availability of human experts and the fatigue and rough estimate procedures involved with them limit the effectiveness of image understanding performed by skilled medical professionals. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are effective tools for image understanding. They have outperformed human experts in many image understanding tasks. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey of applications of CNNs in medical image understanding. The underlying objective is to motivate medical image understanding researchers to extensively apply CNNs in their research and diagnosis. A brief introduction to CNNs has been presented. A discussion on CNN and its various award-winning frameworks have been presented. The major medical image understanding tasks, namely image classification, segmentation, localization and detection have been introduced. Applications of CNN in medical image understanding of the ailments of brain, breast, lung and other organs have been surveyed critically and comprehensively. A critical discussion on some of the challenges is also presented.\n\n【摘要翻译】成像技术被用来捕捉人体的异常。对于异常的诊断、预后和治疗计划，必须了解捕获的图像。医学图像理解通常由熟练的医学专业人员执行。然而，人类专家的稀缺性以及与之相关的疲劳和粗略估计程序限制了熟练医疗专业人员进行图像理解的有效性。卷积神经网络是图像理解的有效工具。在许多图像理解任务中，它们的表现优于人类专家。本文旨在全面综述细胞神经网络在医学图像理解中的应用。其根本目标是激励医学图像理解研究人员在研究和诊断中广泛应用细胞神经网络。简要介绍了细胞神经网络。对CNN及其各种获奖框架进行了讨论。介绍了医学图像理解的主要任务，即图像分类、分割、定位和检测。对CNN在脑、乳、肺等器官疾病医学图像理解中的应用进行了批判性和全面的调查。还对其中一些挑战进行了批判性的讨论。",

		"abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated that feature attribution methods for deep networks can themselves be incorporated into training; these attribution priors optimize for a model whose attributions have certain desirable properties -- most frequently, that particular features are important or unimportant. These attribution priors are often based on attribution methods that are not guaranteed to satisfy desirable interpretability axioms, such as completeness and implementation invariance. Here, we introduce attribution priors to optimize for higher-level properties of explanations, such as smoothness and sparsity, enabled by a fast new attribution method formulation called expected gradients that satisfies many important interpretability axioms. This improves model performance on many real-world tasks where previous attribution priors fail. Our experiments show that the gains from combining higher-level attribution priors with expected gradients attributions are consistent across image, gene expression, and health care data sets. We believe this work motivates and provides the necessary tools to support the widespread adoption of axiomatic attribution priors in many areas of applied machine learning. The implementations and our results have been made freely available to academic communities.\n\n【摘要翻译】最近的研究表明，深度网络的特征归因方法本身可以纳入训练；这些属性先验对于属性具有某些理想属性的模型进行了优化——最常见的情况是，特定特征是重要的或不重要的。这些归因先验通常基于不能保证满足期望的可解释性公理（如完备性和实现不变性）的归因方法。在这里，我们引入了归因先验，以优化解释的更高级别属性，如平滑性和稀疏性，这是由一种称为期望梯度的快速新归因方法公式实现的，该公式满足许多重要的可解释性公理。这提高了模型在许多先前归因先验失败的真实世界任务中的性能。我们的实验表明，将更高级别的归因先验与预期梯度归因相结合所获得的收益在图像、基因表达和医疗保健数据集中是一致的。我们相信，这项工作激励并提供了必要的工具，以支持在应用机器学习的许多领域广泛采用公理化归因先验。这些实施和我们的成果已免费提供给学术界。",

		"abstract": "The fusion of complementary information contained in multi-modality data [e.g., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and genetic data] has advanced the progress of automated Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. However, multi-modality based AD diagnostic models are often hindered by the missing data, i.e., not all the subjects have complete multi-modality data. One simple solution used by many previous studies is to discard samples with missing modalities. However, this significantly reduces the number of training samples, thus leading to a sub-optimal classification model. Furthermore, when building the classification model, most existing methods simply concatenate features from different modalities into a single feature vector without considering their underlying associations. As features from different modalities are often closely related (e.g., MRI and PET features are extracted from the same brain region), utilizing their inter-modality associations may improve the robustness of the diagnostic model. To this end, we propose a novel latent representation learning method for multi-modality based AD diagnosis. Specifically, we use all the available samples (including samples with incomplete modality data) to learn a latent representation space. Within this space, we not only use samples with complete multi-modality data to learn a common latent representation, but also use samples with incomplete multi-modality data to learn independent modality-specific latent representations. We then project the latent representations to the label space for AD diagnosis. We perform experiments using 737 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n\n【摘要翻译】多模态数据[例如，磁共振成像（MRI）、正电子发射断层扫描（PET）和遗传数据]中包含的互补信息的融合推动了阿尔茨海默病（AD）自动化诊断的进展。然而，基于多模态的AD诊断模型经常受到缺失数据的阻碍，即并非所有受试者都有完整的多模态数据。许多先前研究使用的一个简单解决方案是丢弃具有缺失模态的样本。然而，这显著减少了训练样本的数量，从而导致次优分类模型。此外，在构建分类模型时，大多数现有方法只是将来自不同模态的特征连接到单个特征向量中，而不考虑它们的潜在关联。由于来自不同模态的特征往往密切相关（例如，MRI和PET特征是从同一大脑区域提取的），利用它们的模态间关联可以提高诊断模型的稳健性。为此，我们提出了一种新的基于多模态的AD诊断的潜在表征学习方法。具体来说，我们使用所有可用的样本（包括模态数据不完整的样本）来学习潜在的表示空间。在这个空间中，我们不仅使用具有完整多模态数据的样本来学习共同的潜在表征，而且还使用具有不完整多模态的样本来了解独立的模态特定的潜在表征。然后，我们将潜在的表示投影到用于AD诊断的标签空间。我们使用阿尔茨海默病神经成像倡议（ADNI）数据库中的737名受试者进行了实验，实验结果验证了我们提出的方法的有效性。",

		"abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases affect over 20 million people worldwide, and this number is projected to significantly increase in the coming decades. Proposed imaging-based markers have shown steadily improving levels of sensitivity/specificity in classifying individual subjects as AD or normal. Several of these efforts have utilized statistical machine learning techniques, using brain images as input, as means of deriving such AD-related markers. A common characteristic of this line of research is a focus on either (1) using a single imaging modality for classification, or (2) incorporating several modalities, but reporting separate results for each. One strategy to improve on the success of these methods is to leverage all available imaging modalities together in a single automated learning framework. The rationale is that some subjects may show signs of pathology in one modality but not in another—by combining all available images a clearer view of the progression of disease pathology will emerge. Our method is based on the Multi-Kernel Learning (MKL) framework, which allows the inclusion of an arbitrary number of views of the data in a maximum margin, kernel learning framework. The principal innovation behind MKL is that it learns an optimal combination of kernel (similarity) matrices while simultaneously training a classifier. In classification experiments MKL outperformed an SVM trained on all available features by 3%–4%. We are especially interested in whether such markers are capable of identifying early signs of the disease. To address this question, we have examined whether our multi-modal disease marker (MMDM) can predict conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. Our experiments reveal that this measure shows significant group differences between MCI subjects who progressed to AD, and those who remained stable for 3years. These differences were most significant in MMDMs based on imaging data. We also discuss the relationship between our MMDM and an individual's conversion from MCI to AD.\n\n【摘要翻译】阿尔茨海默病（AD）和其他神经退行性疾病影响着全球2000多万人，预计在未来几十年，这一数字还会显著增加。所提出的基于成像的标记物在将个体受试者分类为AD或正常时显示出稳步提高的敏感性/特异性水平。其中一些工作利用了统计机器学习技术，使用大脑图像作为输入，作为推导此类AD相关标记的手段。这一研究领域的一个共同特点是关注（1）使用单一成像模式进行分类，或（2）结合多种模式，但报告每种模式的单独结果。提高这些方法成功率的一个策略是在一个单一的自动化学习框架中综合利用所有可用的成像模式。其原理是，一些受试者可能会以一种方式表现出病理学迹象，但不会以另一种方式——通过结合所有可用的图像，可以更清楚地了解疾病病理学的进展。我们的方法基于多内核学习（MKL）框架，该框架允许在最大限度的内核学习框架中包含任意数量的数据视图。MKL背后的主要创新是，它在训练分类器的同时，学习核（相似性）矩阵的最佳组合。在分类实验中，MKL比在所有可用特征上训练的SVM高出3%-4%。我们特别感兴趣的是这些标志物是否能够识别疾病的早期迹象。为了解决这个问题，我们研究了我们的多模式疾病标志物（MMDM）是否可以预测轻度认知障碍（MCI）向AD的转化。我们的实验表明，这一指标显示了进展为AD的MCI受试者与稳定3年的MCI被试者之间的显著组间差异。这些差异在基于成像数据的MMDM中最为显著。我们还讨论了我们的MMDM与个人从MCI转换为AD之间的关系。",

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) showed a lot of potential to generate synthetic MRI data that can capture the distribution of real MRI. Besides, GANs are also popular for segmentation, noise removal, and super-resolution of brain MRI images. This scoping review aims to explore how GANs methods are being used on brain MRI data, as reported in the literature. The review describes the different applications of GANs for brain MRI, presents the most commonly used GANs architectures, and summarizes the publicly available brain MRI datasets for advancing the research and development of GANs-based approaches. This review followed the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR to perform the study search and selection. The search was conducted on five popular scientific databases. The screening and selection of studies were performed by two independent reviewers, followed by validation by a third reviewer. Finally, the data were synthesized using a narrative approach. This review included 139 studies out of 789 search results. The most common use case of GANs was the synthesis of brain MRI images for data augmentation. GANs were also used to segment brain tumors and translate healthy images to diseased images or CT to MRI and vice versa. The included studies showed that GANs could enhance the performance of AI methods used on brain MRI imaging data. However, more efforts are needed to transform the GANs-based methods in clinical applications.\n\n【摘要翻译】如果有足够的数据可用，人工智能在大脑MRI中的性能可以提高。生成对抗性网络（GANs）在生成能够捕捉真实MRI分布的合成MRI数据方面显示出很大的潜力。此外，GANs在脑MRI图像的分割、降噪和超分辨率方面也很受欢迎。正如文献中所报道的，这篇范围界定综述旨在探索GANs方法是如何用于大脑MRI数据的。该综述描述了GANs在脑MRI中的不同应用，介绍了最常用的GANs架构，并总结了公开可用的脑MRI数据集，用于推进基于GANs的方法的研究和开发。本综述遵循PRISMA ScR的指南进行研究搜索和选择。搜索是在五个流行的科学数据库上进行的。研究的筛选和选择由两名独立评审员进行，然后由第三名评审员进行验证。最后，使用叙述方法对数据进行了综合。这篇综述包括789个搜索结果中的139项研究。GANs最常见的使用案例是用于数据增强的大脑MRI图像的合成。GANs还用于分割脑肿瘤，并将健康图像转换为病变图像，或将CT转换为MRI，反之亦然。纳入的研究表明，GANs可以提高用于大脑MRI成像数据的人工智能方法的性能。然而，在临床应用中，需要更多的努力来转变基于GANs的方法。",

However, the classification performance is difficult to compare across studies due to variations in components such as participant selection, image preprocessing or validation procedure. Moreover, these studies are hardly reproducible because their frameworks are not publicly accessible and because implementation details are lacking. Lastly, some of these papers may report a biased performance due to inadequate or unclear validation or model selection procedures. In the present work, we aim to address these limitations through three main contributions. First, we performed a systematic literature review. We identified four main types of approaches: i) 2D slice-level, ii) 3D patch-level, iii) ROI-based and iv) 3D subject-level CNN. Moreover, we found that more than half of the surveyed papers may have suffered from data leakage and thus reported biased performance. Our second contribution is the extension of our open-source framework for classification of AD using CNN and T1-weighted MRI. The framework comprises previously developed tools to automatically convert ADNI, AIBL and OASIS data into the BIDS standard, and a modular set of image preprocessing procedures, classification architectures and evaluation procedures dedicated to deep learning. Finally, we used this framework to rigorously compare different CNN architectures. The data was split into training/validation/test sets at the very beginning and only the training/validation sets were used for model selection. To avoid any overfitting, the test sets were left untouched until the end of the peer-review process. Overall, the different 3D approaches (3D-subject, 3D-ROI, 3D-patch) achieved similar performances while that of the 2D slice approach was lower. Of note, the different CNN approaches did not perform better than a SVM with voxel-based features. The different approaches generalized well to similar populations but not to datasets with different inclusion criteria or demographical characteristics. All the code of the framework and the experiments is publicly available: general-purpose tools have been integrated into the Clinica software (www.clinica.run) and the paper-specific code is available at: https://github.com/aramis-lab/AD-DL.",

		"abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a kind of dementia that is mostly experienced by people who are in the age of early 60s. In AD, brain cells that are responsible for forming memories and cognitive decisions, get affected which causes overall gray matter shrinkage in the human brain. Since AD patients are growing exponentially in the world, researchers are trying to develop an accurate mechanism for diagnosing the disease using brain images. In this paper, several research articles on AD classification are analyzed along with detailed observations. We have summarized as well as compared the research articles based on their classification performance. Although all the reviewed articles have the potential to classify AD, still there lies major future challenges. Among all the reviewed papers, it is found that the recent deep neural network-based classification techniques can produce the most promising results with an average performance rate of 93%.",

		"abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia. Currently, no treatment exists to slow down or stop the progression of AD. There is converging belief that disease-modifying treatments should focus on early stages of the disease, that is, the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and preclinical stages. Making a diagnosis of AD and offering a prognosis (likelihood of converting to AD) at these early stages are challenging tasks but possible with the help of multimodality imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission topography (PET), amyloid-PET, and recently introduced tau-PET, which provides different but complementary information. This article is a focused review of existing research in the recent decade that used statistical machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to perform quantitative analysis of multimodality image data for diagnosis and prognosis of AD at the MCI or preclinical stages. We review the existing work in 3 subareas: diagnosis, prognosis, and methods for handling modality-wise missing data—a commonly encountered problem when using multimodality imaging for prediction or classification. Factors contributing to missing data include lack of imaging equipment, cost, difficulty of obtaining patient consent, and patient drop-off (in longitudinal studies). Finally, we summarize our major findings and provide some recommendations for potential future research directions.",

		"abstract": "Neuroimaging techniques are widely used in neuroscience to visualize neural activity, to improve our understanding of brain mechanisms, and to identify biomarkers—especially for psychiatric diseases; however, each neuroimaging technique has several limitations. These limitations led to the development of multimodal neuroimaging (MN), which combines data obtained from multiple neuroimaging techniques, such as electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and yields more detailed information about brain dynamics. There are several types of MN, including visual inspection, data integration, and data fusion. This literature review aimed to provide a brief summary and basic information about MN techniques (data fusion approaches in particular) and classification approaches. Data fusion approaches are generally categorized as asymmetric and symmetric. The present review focused exclusively on studies based on symmetric data fusion methods (data-driven methods), such as independent component analysis and principal component analysis. Machine learning techniques have recently been introduced for use in identifying diseases and biomarkers of disease. The machine learning technique most widely used by neuroscientists is classification—especially support vector machine classification. Several studies differentiated patients with psychiatric diseases and healthy controls with using combined datasets. The common conclusion among these studies is that the prediction of diseases increases when combining data via MN techniques; however, there remain a few challenges associated with MN, such as sample size. Perhaps in the future N-way fusion can be used to combine multiple neuroimaging techniques or nonimaging predictors (eg, cognitive ability) to overcome the limitations of MN.",

The fusion of multiple data modalities can provide a holistic view of AD staging analysis. Thus, we use deep learning (DL) to integrally analyze imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)), and clinical test data to classify patients into AD, MCI, and controls (CN). We use stacked denoising auto-encoders to extract features from clinical and genetic data, and use 3D-convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for imaging data. We also develop a novel data interpretation method to identify top-performing features learned by the deep-models with clustering and perturbation analysis. Using Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset, we demonstrate that deep models outperform shallow models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors. In addition, we demonstrate that integrating multi-modality data outperforms single modality models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and meanF1 scores. Our models have identified hippocampus, amygdala brain areas, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) as top distinguished features, which are consistent with the known AD literature.",

		"abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries. From a research point of view, impressive results have been reported using computer-aided algorithms, but clinically no practical diagnostic method is available. In recent years, deep models have become popular, especially in dealing with images. Since 2013, deep learning has begun to gain considerable attention in AD detection research, with the number of published papers in this area increasing drastically since 2017. Deep models have been reported to be more accurate for AD detection compared to general machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, AD detection is still challenging, and for classification, it requires a highly discriminative feature representation to separate similar brain patterns. This paper reviews the current state of AD detection using deep learning. Through a systematic literature review of over 100 articles, we set out the most recent findings and trends. Specifically, we review useful biomarkers and features (personal information, genetic data, and brain scans), the necessary pre-processing steps, and different ways of dealing with neuroimaging data originating from single-modality and multi-modality studies. Deep models and their performance are described in detail. Although deep learning has achieved notable performance in detecting AD, there are several limitations, especially regarding the availability of datasets and training procedures.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Most clinico-neuropathological correlative studies of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are based on research cohorts that are not necessarily generalizable to patients seen in the general medical community. In this study, we examine the accuracy of the criteria used in diagnosing AD in a community-based case series of patients with memory complaints. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Clinical and neuropathological diagnoses were obtained from 134 patients evaluated for dementia who subsequently underwent autopsy. SETTING: Subjects who exhibited new symptoms of dementia and were enrolled in the University of Washington/Group Health Cooperative Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry were eligible for this study. MEASUREMENTS: Clinico-pathological correlation was performed using NINCDS-ADRDA (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association) and CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) criteria. RESULTS: Ninety-five of the 134 cases studied met CERAD neuropathological criteria for AD. The sensitivity of NINCDS-ADRDA “probable AD” was 83% (diagnosing AD correctly) and overall clinical diagnostic accuracy was 75%. However, there was a high rate of additional neuropathological findings. Only 34 of the 94 cases had pure AD on neuropathology, whereas the remainder frequently had coexisting vascular or Parkinson's disease lesions. CONCLUSIONS: This study of a large series of community-based incident dementia cases provides a way of judging the adequacy of currently available clinical diagnostic criteria. It also shows that co-existing neuropathological findings are common in community-based AD.

		"abstract": "Deep learning (DL) algorithms based on brain MRI images have achieved great success in the prediction of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with classification accuracy exceeding even that of the most experienced clinical experts. As a novel feature fusion method, Transformer has achieved excellent performance in many computer vision tasks, which also greatly promotes the application of Transformer in medical images. However, when Transformer is used for 3D MRI image feature fusion, existing DL models treat the input local features equally, which is inconsistent with the fact that adjacent voxels have stronger semantic connections than spatially distant voxels. In addition, due to the relatively small size of the dataset for medical images, it is difficult to capture local lesion features in limited iterative training by treating all input features equally. This paper proposes a deep learning model Conv-Swinformer that focuses on extracting and integrating local fine-grained features. Conv-Swinformer consists of a CNN module and a Transformer encoder module. The CNN module summarizes the planar features of the MRI slices, and the Transformer module establishes semantic connections in 3D space for these planar features. By introducing the shift window attention mechanism in the Transformer encoder, the attention is focused on a small spatial area of the MRI image, which effectively reduces unnecessary background semantic information and enables the model to capture local features more accurately. In addition, the layer-by-layer enlarged attention window can further integrate local fine-grained features, thus enhancing the model’s attention ability. Compared with DL algorithms that indiscriminately fuse local features of MRI images, Conv-Swinformer can fine-grained extract local lesion features, thus achieving better classification results.\n\n【摘要翻译】基于大脑MRI图像的深度学习（DL）算法在阿尔茨海默病（AD）的预测中取得了巨大成功，分类精度甚至超过了最有经验的临床专家。Transformer作为一种新的特征融合方法，在许多计算机视觉任务中都取得了优异的性能，这也极大地促进了Transformer在医学图像中的应用。然而，当Transformer用于3D MRI图像特征融合时，现有的DL模型平等地对待输入的局部特征，这与相邻体素比空间距离远的体素具有更强的语义连接的事实不一致。此外，由于医学图像数据集的大小相对较小，很难在有限的迭代训练中通过平等对待所有输入特征来捕捉局部病变特征。本文提出了一种深度学习模型Conv-Swinformer，该模型侧重于提取和集成局部细粒度特征。Conv Swinformer由CNN模块和Transformer编码器模块组成。CNN模块总结MRI切片的平面特征，Transformer模块在3D空间中为这些平面特征建立语义连接。通过在Transformer编码器中引入移位窗口注意力机制，将注意力集中在MRI图像的小空间区域，有效地减少了不必要的背景语义信息，使模型能够更准确地捕捉局部特征。此外，逐层放大的注意力窗口可以进一步整合局部细粒度特征，从而增强模型的注意力能力。与不加区分地融合MRI图像局部特征的DL算法相比，Conv Swinformer可以细粒度地提取局部病变特征，从而获得更好的分类结果。",

		"abstract": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plays a key role in preventing and responding to this neurodegenerative disease. It has shown that, compared with a single imaging modality-based classification of AD, synergy exploration among multimodal neuroimages is beneficial for the pathological identification. However, effectively exploiting multimodal information is still a big challenge due to the lack of efficient fusion methods. Herein, a multimodal fusion network based on attention mechanism is proposed, in which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission computed tomography (PET) images are converted into feature vectors with the same dimension, while the demographic information and clinical data are preprocessed and converted into feature vectors through embedding. This attention model can focus on important feature points, fuse the multimodal information more effectively, and thus provide accurate diagnosis and prediction for different pathological stages. The results show that the model achieves an accuracy of 84.1% for triple classification tasks in normal cognition (NC) versus mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus AD and 93.9% prediction accuracy in stable MCI (sMCI) versus progressive MCI (pMCI). In contrast to the existing multimodal diagnosis methods, our model yields a state-of-the-art accuracy of AD diagnosis, which is powerful and promising in clinical practice.\n\n【摘要翻译】阿尔茨海默病（AD）的早期诊断在预防和应对这种神经退行性疾病方面发挥着关键作用。研究表明，与基于单一成像模式的AD分类相比，多模式神经图像之间的协同探索有利于病理识别。然而，由于缺乏有效的融合方法，有效利用多模式信息仍然是一个巨大的挑战。本文提出了一种基于注意力机制的多模式融合网络，将磁共振成像（MRI）和正电子发射计算机断层扫描（PET）图像转换为相同维度的特征向量，同时对人口统计信息和临床数据进行预处理，并通过嵌入转换为特征向量。该注意力模型可以聚焦重要特征点，更有效地融合多模态信息，从而为不同的病理阶段提供准确的诊断和预测。结果表明，该模型在正常认知（NC）与轻度认知障碍（MCI）与AD的三重分类任务中实现了84.1%的准确率，在稳定MCI（sMCI）与渐进MCI（pMCI）中实现了93.9%的预测准确率。与现有的多模式诊断方法相比，我们的模型产生了最先进的AD诊断准确性，这在临床实践中是强大而有前景的。",

		"abstract": "Medical image acquisition plays a significant role in the diagnosis and management of diseases. Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Computed Tomography (CT) are considered two of the most popular modalities for medical image acquisition. Some considerations, such as cost and radiation dose, may limit the acquisition of certain image modalities. Therefore, medical image synthesis can be used to generate required medical images without actual acquisition. In this paper, we propose a paired–unpaired Unsupervised Attention Guided Generative Adversarial Network (uagGAN) model to translate MR images to CT images and vice versa. The uagGAN model is pre-trained with a paired dataset for initialization and then retrained on an unpaired dataset using a cascading process. In the paired pre-training stage, we enhance the loss function of our model by combining the Wasserstein GAN adversarial loss function with a new combination of non-adversarial losses (content loss and L1) to generate fine structure images. This will ensure global consistency, and better capture of the high and low frequency details of the generated images. The uagGAN model is employed as it generates more accurate and sharper images through the production of attention masks. Knowledge from a non-medical pre-trained model is also transferred to the uagGAN model for improved learning and better image translation performance. Quantitative evaluation and qualitative perceptual analysis by radiologists indicate that employing transfer learning with the proposed paired-unpaired uagGAN model can achieve better performance as compared to other rival image-to-image translation models.\n\n【摘要翻译】医学图像采集在疾病的诊断和管理中发挥着重要作用。磁共振（MR）和计算机断层扫描（CT）被认为是医学图像采集的两种最流行的方式。一些考虑因素，如成本和辐射剂量，可能会限制某些图像模态的获取。因此，可以使用医学图像合成来生成所需的医学图像，而无需实际采集。在本文中，我们提出了一种配对-非配对的无监督注意力引导生成对抗性网络（uagGAN）模型，用于将MR图像转换为CT图像，反之亦然。uagGAN模型使用配对数据集进行预训练以进行初始化，然后使用级联过程在未配对的数据集上进行再训练。在配对预训练阶段，我们通过将Wasserstein GAN对抗性损失函数与非对抗性损失（内容损失和L1）的新组合相结合来增强模型的损失函数，以生成精细结构图像。这将确保全局一致性，并更好地捕捉生成图像的高频和低频细节。采用uagGAN模型是因为它通过制作注意力掩模来生成更准确、更清晰的图像。来自非医学预训练模型的知识也被转移到uagGAN模型，以改进学习和更好的图像翻译性能。放射科医生的定量评估和定性感知分析表明，与其他竞争对手的图像到图像翻译模型相比，将迁移学习与所提出的配对不配对的uagGAN模型相结合可以实现更好的性能。",

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, accounting for at least two-thirds of cases of dementia in people age 65 and older. Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease with insidious onset and progressive impairment of behavioral and cognitive functions including memory, comprehension, language, attention, reasoning, and judgment. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Onset before 65 years of age (early onset) is unusual and seen in less than 10% of Alzheimer's disease patients. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, although there are treatments available that may improve some symptoms. Symptoms of Alzheimer's disease depend on the stage of the disease. Alzheimer's disease is classified into preclinical or presymptomatic, mild, and dementia-stage depending on the degree of cognitive impairment. These stages are different from the DSM-5 classification of Alzheimer's disease. The initial and most common presenting symptom is episodic short-term memory loss with relative sparing of long-term memory and can be elicited in most patients even when not the presenting symptom. Short-term memory impairment is followed by impairment in problem-solving, judgment, executive functioning, lack of motivation and disorganization, leading to problems with multitasking and abstract thinking. In the early stages, impairment in executive functioning ranges from subtle to significant. This is followed by language disorder and impairment of visuospatial skills. Neuropsychiatric symptoms like apathy, social withdrawal, disinhibition, agitation, psychosis, and wandering are also common in the mid to late stages. Difficulty performing learned motor tasks (dyspraxia), olfactory dysfunction, sleep disturbances, extrapyramidal motor signs like dystonia, akathisia, and parkinsonian symptoms occur late in the disease. This is followed by primitive reflexes, incontinence, and total dependence on caregivers.,,\n\n【摘要翻译】痴呆症是一个通用术语，指的是认知能力的下降，严重到足以干扰日常生活活动。阿尔茨海默病（AD）是最常见的痴呆症类型，至少占65岁及以上人群痴呆症病例的三分之二。阿尔茨海默病是一种神经退行性疾病，发病隐匿，行为和认知功能（包括记忆、理解、语言、注意力、推理和判断）逐渐受损。它是美国第六大死因。在65岁之前发病（早发）是不寻常的，只有不到10%的阿尔茨海默病患者发病。阿尔茨海默病没有治愈方法，尽管有一些治疗方法可以改善一些症状。阿尔茨海默病的症状取决于疾病的阶段。阿尔茨海默病根据认知障碍的程度分为临床前或症状前、轻度和痴呆阶段。这些阶段与阿尔茨海默病的DSM-5分类不同。最初和最常见的症状是发作性短期记忆丧失，长期记忆相对较少，即使不是症状，大多数患者也会出现这种症状。短期记忆障碍之后是解决问题、判断、执行功能的障碍、缺乏动力和组织混乱，导致多任务处理和抽象思维的问题。在早期阶段，执行功能的损害从轻微到严重不等。随之而来的是语言障碍和视觉空间技能的损害。神经精神症状，如冷漠、社交退缩、去抑制、激动、精神病和流浪，在中后期也很常见。学习性运动任务执行困难（运动障碍）、嗅觉功能障碍、睡眠障碍、锥体外系运动体征，如肌张力障碍、静坐障碍和帕金森病症状，在疾病晚期出现。随之而来的是原始反射、失禁和对照顾者的完全依赖。，，",

		"abstract": "Alzheimer's disease acknowledged as progressive multifarious neurodegenerative disorder, is the leading cause of dementia in late adult life. Pathologically it is characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloidal protein deposits contributing to senile plaques. Over the last two decades, advances in the field of pathogenesis have inspired the researchers for the investigation of novel pharmacological therapeutics centered more towards the pathophysiological events of the disease. Currently available treatments i.e. acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, galantamine, donepezil) and N-methyl d-aspartate receptor antagonist (memantine) contribute minimal impact on the disease and target late aspects of the disease. These drugs decelerate the progression of the disease, provide symptomatic relief but fail to achieve a definite cure. While the neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease are recognized but the intricacies of the mechanism have not been clearly defined. This lack of understanding regarding the pathogenic process may be the likely reason for the non-availability of effective treatment which can prevent onset and progression of the disease. Owing to the important progress in the field of pathophysiology in the last couple of years, new therapeutic targets are available that should render the underlying disease process to be tackled directly. In this review, authors will discusses the different aspects of pathophysiological mechanisms behind Alzheimer's disease and its management through conventional drug therapy, including modern investigational therapeutic strategies, recently completed and ongoing.\n\n【摘要翻译】阿尔茨海默病被公认为进行性多种神经退行性疾病，是成年晚期痴呆症的主要原因。病理学特征是细胞内神经原纤维缠结和细胞外淀粉样蛋白沉积导致老年斑块。在过去的二十年里，发病机制领域的进展激发了研究人员对新的药物疗法的研究，这些疗法更多地集中在疾病的病理生理事件上。目前可用的治疗方法，即乙酰胆碱酯酶抑制剂（利瓦斯汀、加兰他敏、多奈哌齐）和N-甲基d-天冬氨酸受体拮抗剂（美金刚）对疾病的影响最小，并针对疾病的晚期。这些药物减缓了疾病的进展，提供了症状缓解，但未能达到确切的治愈效果。虽然阿尔茨海默病的神经病理学特征已被公认，但其复杂的机制尚未明确定义。对致病过程缺乏了解可能是无法获得有效治疗的原因，这种治疗可以防止疾病的发作和进展。由于过去几年在病理生理学领域取得了重要进展，有了新的治疗靶点，应该可以直接解决潜在的疾病过程。在这篇综述中，作者将讨论阿尔茨海默病背后的病理生理机制的不同方面，以及通过传统药物治疗对其进行管理，包括最近完成和正在进行的现代研究性治疗策略。",

		"abstract": "This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and morbidity, costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. The Special Report examines the benefits of diagnosing Alzheimer's earlier in the disease process, in the stage of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. An estimated 5.7 million Americans have Alzheimer's dementia. By mid-century, the number of people living with Alzheimer's dementia in the United States is projected to grow to 13.8 million, fueled in large part by the aging baby boom generation. In 2015, official death certificates recorded 110,561 deaths from AD, making AD the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age ≥65 years. Between 2000 and 2015, deaths resulting from stroke, heart disease, and prostate cancer decreased, whereas deaths from AD increased 123%. In 2017, more than 16 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.4 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. This care is valued at more than \\232 billion, but its costs extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age ≥65 years with Alzheimer's or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2018 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age ≥65 years with dementia are estimated to be \\277 billion. With the identification of AD biomarkers in recent years, our understanding of the disease has moved from one based on symptoms to one based on brain changes. Because these changes begin well before clinical symptoms arise, Alzheimer's has the potential to be diagnosed before the dementia stage. Early diagnosis of AD could have important personal and financial benefits. A mathematical model estimates that early and accurate diagnosis could save up to $7.9 trillion in medical and care costs.\n\n【摘要翻译】本文描述了阿尔茨海默病对公共健康的影响，包括发病率和患病率、死亡率和发病率、护理成本，以及对护理人员和社会的总体影响。特别报告探讨了在阿尔茨海默病引起的轻度认知障碍阶段，在疾病过程的早期诊断阿尔茨海默病的益处。据估计，570万美国人患有老年痴呆症。到本世纪中叶，美国阿尔茨海默病痴呆症患者人数预计将增至1380万，这在很大程度上是由婴儿潮一代的老龄化推动的。2015年，官方死亡证明记录了110561例AD死亡，使AD成为美国第六大死亡原因，也是65岁以上美国人第五大死亡原因。2000年至2015年间，中风、心脏病和前列腺癌症导致的死亡人数减少，而AD导致的死亡增加了123%。2017年，超过1600万家庭成员和其他无偿护理人员为阿尔茨海默氏症或其他痴呆症患者提供了估计184亿小时的护理。这种护理的价值超过2320亿英镑，但其成本延伸到家庭护理人员情绪困扰和负面身心健康结果的风险增加。为年龄≥65岁患有阿尔茨海默氏症或其他痴呆症的受益人提供服务的人均医疗保险付款是没有这些疾病的受益人的三倍多，医疗补助付款是23倍多。2018年，为≥65岁的痴呆症患者提供的医疗保健、长期护理和临终关怀服务的总付款估计为2770亿英镑。近年来，随着AD生物标志物的鉴定，我们对该疾病的理解已经从基于症状的理解转变为基于大脑变化的理解。因为这些变化早在临床症状出现之前就开始了，阿尔茨海默氏症有可能在痴呆症阶段之前被诊断出来。AD的早期诊断可能会带来重要的个人和经济利益。一个数学模型估计，早期准确的诊断可以节省高达7.9万亿美元的医疗和护理成本。",

		"abstract": "China’s population has rapidly aged over the recent decades of social and economic development as neurodegenerative disorders have proliferated, especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). AD’s incidence rate, morbidity, and mortality have steadily increased to make it presently the fifth leading cause of death among urban and rural residents in China and magnify the resulting financial burdens on individuals, families and society. The ‘Healthy China Action’ plan of 2019–2030 promotes the transition from disease treatment to health maintenance for this expanding population with ADRD. This report describes related epidemiological trends, evaluates the economic burden of the disease, outlines current clinical diagnosis and treatment status and delineates existing available public health resources. More specifically, it examines the public health impact of ADRD, including prevalence, mortality, costs, usage of care, and the overall effect on caregivers and society. In addition, this special report presents technical guidance and supports for the prevention and treatment of AD, provides expertise to guide relevant governmental healthcare policy development and suggests an information platform for international exchange and cooperation.\n\n【摘要翻译】在近几十年的社会和经济发展中，随着神经退行性疾病的激增，尤其是阿尔茨海默病（AD）和相关痴呆症（ADRD），中国人口迅速老龄化。AD的发病率、发病率和死亡率稳步上升，目前已成为中国城乡居民死亡的第五大原因，并加重了个人、家庭和社会的经济负担。2019-2030年的“健康中国行动”计划促进了这一不断扩大的ADRD人群从疾病治疗向健康维护的转变。本报告描述了相关的流行病学趋势，评估了该疾病的经济负担，概述了当前的临床诊断和治疗状况，并描述了现有的可用公共卫生资源。更具体地说，它研究了ADRD对公共卫生的影响，包括流行率、死亡率、成本、护理使用以及对护理人员和社会的总体影响。此外，本特别报告为AD的预防和治疗提供了技术指导和支持，提供了指导相关政府医疗保健政策制定的专业知识，并为国际交流与合作提供了信息平台。",

		"abstract": "ABSTRACT\n            Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid β in the form of extracellular plaques and by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, with eventual neurodegeneration and dementia. There is currently no disease-modifying treatment though several symptomatic medications exist with modest benefit on cognition. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have a consistent benefit across all stages of dementia; their benefit in mild cognitive impairment and prodromal AD is unproven. Memantine has a smaller benefit on cognition overall which is limited to the moderate to severe stages, and the combination of a cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may have additional efficacy. Evidence for the efficacy of vitamin E supplementation and medical foods is weak but might be considered in the context of cost, availability, and safety in individual patients. Apparently promising disease-modifying interventions, mostly addressing the amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD, have recently failed to demonstrate efficacy so novel approaches must be considered.\n\n【摘要翻译】摘要阿尔茨海默病（AD）是一种进行性神经退行性疾病，其特征是淀粉样蛋白β以细胞外斑块和细胞内神经原纤维缠结的形式积聚，最终导致神经退行性变和痴呆。目前还没有改变疾病的治疗方法，尽管有几种有症状的药物对认知有一定的益处。乙酰胆碱酯酶抑制剂对痴呆症的所有阶段都有持续的益处；它们对轻度认知障碍和前驱AD的益处尚未得到证实。美金刚对认知的总体益处较小，仅限于中度至重度阶段，胆碱酯酶抑制剂和美金刚的组合可能具有额外的疗效。补充维生素E和医用食品的有效性证据不足，但可以从成本、可用性和个体患者的安全性角度进行考虑。显然有希望的疾病改善干预措施，主要针对AD的淀粉样蛋白级联假说，最近未能证明其有效性，因此必须考虑新的方法。",

		"abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) such as depression, apathy, aggression, and psychosis are now recognized as core features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and there is a general consensus that greater symptom severity is predictive of faster cognitive decline, loss of independence, and even shorter survival. Whether these symptoms result from the same pathogenic processes responsible for cognitive decline or have unique etiologies independent of AD-associated neurodegeneration is unclear. Many structural and metabolic features of the AD brain are associated with individual neuropsychiatric symptoms or symptom clusters. In addition, many genes have been identified and confirmed that are associated with symptom risk in a few cases. However, there are no single genes strongly predictive of individual neuropsychiatric syndromes, while functional and structural brain changes unique to specific symptoms may reflect variability in progression of the same pathological processes. Unfortunately, treatment success for these psychiatric symptoms may be lower when comorbid with AD, underscoring the importance of future research on their pathobiology and treatment. This review summarizes some of the most salient aspects of NPS pathogenesis.\n\n【摘要翻译】神经精神症状（NPS），如抑郁、冷漠、攻击性和精神病，现在被认为是阿尔茨海默病（AD）的核心特征，人们普遍认为，更严重的症状预示着认知能力更快下降、独立性丧失，甚至生存期更短。这些症状是由导致认知能力下降的相同致病过程引起的，还是具有独立于AD相关神经退行性变的独特病因尚不清楚。AD大脑的许多结构和代谢特征与个体神经精神症状或症状群有关。此外，在少数病例中，许多与症状风险相关的基因已被鉴定和证实。然而，没有单一基因能有力地预测个体神经精神综合征，而特定症状特有的大脑功能和结构变化可能反映了相同病理过程进展的可变性。不幸的是，当与AD共病时，这些精神症状的治疗成功率可能较低，这突出了未来研究其病理生物学和治疗的重要性。这篇综述总结了NPS发病机制的一些最突出的方面。",

		"abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia. However, neither Alzheimer’s disease nor Alzheimer’s dementia are an inevitable consequence of aging. This review provides an overview of the issues involved in a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease before an individual meets the criteria for Alzheimer’s dementia. It examines how Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis rates can be improved, the implications of an early diagnosis for the individual, carer and society, and the importance of risk reduction to prevent or delay progression. Although no disease-modifying agents capable of reversing the initial pathological changes are currently available, it may be possible to prevent or delay the development of dementia in a proportion of the population by modifying exposure to common risk factors. In other individuals, diagnosing the disease or risk of disease early is still valuable so that the individual and their carers have time to make choices and plan for the future, and to allow access to treatments that can help manage symptoms. Primary healthcare professionals play a pivotal role in recognising individuals at risk, recommending lifestyle changes in mid-adult life that can prevent or slow down the disease, and in timely diagnosis. Early intervention is the optimal strategy, because the patient’s level of function is preserved for longer.\n\n【摘要翻译】阿尔茨海默病是痴呆症的主要病因。然而，阿尔茨海默病和阿尔茨海默痴呆症都不是衰老的必然结果。这篇综述概述了在个人符合阿尔茨海默氏症痴呆症标准之前诊断阿尔茨海默氏症所涉及的问题。它研究了如何提高阿尔茨海默病的诊断率，早期诊断对个人、护理人员和社会的影响，以及降低风险对预防或延缓进展的重要性。尽管目前还没有能够逆转最初病理变化的疾病调节剂，但通过改变对常见风险因素的暴露，可以在一定比例的人群中预防或延缓痴呆症的发展。对其他人来说，早期诊断疾病或疾病风险仍然很有价值，这样个人和他们的护理人员就有时间做出选择和规划未来，并获得有助于控制症状的治疗。初级保健专业人员在识别有风险的个人、建议中年生活方式的改变以预防或减缓疾病以及及时诊断方面发挥着关键作用。早期干预是最佳策略，因为患者的功能水平可以保持更长时间。",

In some patients, however, MCI is a more benign condition, which may not progress to AD or may do so slowly.Patients:— Eighty consecutive patients who met criteria for the diagnosis of MCI were recruited from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Center/Alzheimer’s Disease Patient Registry.\nMethods: At entry into the study, each patient received an MRI examination of the head, from which the volumes of both hippocampi were measured. Patients were followed longitudinally with approximately annual clinical/cognitive assessments. The primary endpoint was the crossover of individual MCI patients to the clinical diagnosis of AD during longitudinal clinical follow-up.\nResults: During the period of longitudinal observation, which averaged 32.6 months, 27 of the 80 MCI patients became demented. Hippocampal atrophy at baseline was associated with crossover from MCI to AD (relative risk [RR], 0.69, p = 0.015). When hippocampal volume was entered into bivariate models—using age, postmenopausal estrogen replacement, standard neuropsychological tests, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, history of ischemic heart disease, and hypertension—the RRs were not substantially different from that found univariately, and the associations between hippocampal volume and crossover remained significant.\nConclusion: In older patients with MCI, hippocampal atrophy determined by premorbid MRI-based volume measurements is predictive of subsequent conversion to AD.\n\n【摘要翻译】目的：验证基于MRI的海马体积测量与患有轻度认知障碍（MCI）的老年患者未来转化为阿尔茨海默病（AD）的风险相关的假设。背景：发展为AD的患者会经历一种过渡状态，这种状态可以被表征为MCI。然而，在一些患者中，MCI是一种更为良性的疾病，可能不会进展为AD，也可能进展缓慢。患者：从梅奥诊所阿尔茨海默病中心/阿尔茨海默病患者登记处招募了连续80名符合MCI诊断标准的患者。方法：在进入研究时，每位患者都接受了头部MRI检查，测量了两个海马的体积。对患者进行纵向随访，进行大约每年一次的临床/认知评估。主要终点是在纵向临床随访期间，单个MCI患者与AD临床诊断的交叉。结果：在平均32.6个月的纵向观察期间，80例MCI患者中有27例出现痴呆。基线时的海马萎缩与MCI到AD的交叉相关（相对风险[RR]，0.69，p=0.015）。当使用年龄、绝经后雌激素替代、标准神经心理学测试、载脂蛋白E（APOE）基因型、缺血性心脏病病史和高血压将海马体积纳入双变量模型时，RR与单变量模型没有显著差异，海马体积与交叉之间的关联仍然显著。结论：在老年MCI患者中，通过基于病前MRI的体积测量确定的海马萎缩可预测随后转化为AD。",

		"abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible brain disease that severely damages human thinking and memory. Early diagnosis plays an important part in the prevention and treatment of AD. Neuroimaging-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has shown that deep learning methods using multimodal images are beneficial to guide AD detection. In recent years, many methods based on multimodal feature learning have been proposed to extract and fuse latent representation information from different neuroimaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). However, these methods lack the interpretability required to clearly explain the specific meaning of the extracted information. To make the multimodal fusion process more persuasive, we propose an image fusion method to aid AD diagnosis. Specifically, we fuse the gray matter (GM) tissue area of brain MRI and FDG-PET images by registration and mask coding to obtain a new fused modality called “GM-PET.” The resulting single composite image emphasizes the GM area that is critical for AD diagnosis, while retaining both the contour and metabolic characteristics of the subject's brain tissue. In addition, we use the three-dimensional simple convolutional neural network (3D Simple CNN) and 3D Multi-Scale CNN to evaluate the effectiveness of our image fusion method in binary classification and multi-classification tasks. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset indicate that the proposed image fusion method achieves better overall performance than unimodal and feature fusion methods, and that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods for AD diagnosis.",

		"abstract": "Neural oscillations were established with their association with neurophysiological activities and the altered rhythmic patterns are believed to be linked directly to the progression of cognitive decline. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive technique to record such neuronal activity due to excellent temporal and fair amount of spatial resolution. Single channel, connectivity as well as brain network analysis using MEG data in resting state and task-based experiments were analyzed from existing literature. Single channel analysis studies reported a less complex, more regular and predictable oscillations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily in the left parietal, temporal and occipital regions. Investigations on both functional connectivity (FC) and effective (EC) connectivity analysis demonstrated a loss of connectivity in AD compared to healthy control (HC) subjects found in higher frequency bands. It has been reported from multiplex network of MEG study in AD in the affected regions of hippocampus, posterior default mode network (DMN) and occipital areas, however, conclusions cannot be drawn due to limited availability of clinical literature. Potential utilization of high spatial resolution in MEG likely to provide information related to in-depth brain functioning and underlying factors responsible for changes in neuronal waves in AD. This review is a comprehensive report to investigate diagnostic biomarkers for AD may be identified by from MEG data. It is also important to note that MEG data can also be utilized for the same pursuit in combination with other imaging modalities.\n\n【摘要翻译】神经振荡与神经生理学活动有关，节律模式的改变被认为与认知能力下降的进展直接相关。脑磁图（MEG）是一种记录这种神经元活动的非侵入性技术，具有良好的时间分辨率和相当大的空间分辨率。从现有文献中分析了静息状态和基于任务的实验中使用脑电信号数据的单通道、连通性以及脑网络分析。单通道分析研究报告称，阿尔茨海默病（AD）的振荡不那么复杂、更规律、更可预测，主要发生在左顶叶、颞叶和枕叶区域。对功能连接（FC）和有效连接（EC）分析的研究表明，与健康对照（HC）受试者相比，AD受试者在高频带中的连接缺失。据报道，在AD的海马、后缺省模式网络（DMN）和枕叶区域进行的MEG研究的多重网络，但由于临床文献的可用性有限，无法得出结论。脑磁图中高空间分辨率的潜在利用可能提供与深入大脑功能和导致AD神经元波变化的潜在因素相关的信息。这篇综述是一篇全面的报告，旨在研究脑磁图数据中可能识别的AD诊断生物标志物。同样重要的是要注意，MEG数据也可以与其他成像模态组合用于相同的追踪。",

		"abstract": "The ability to synthesize realistic patterns of neural activity is crucial for studying neural information processing. Here we used the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework to simulate the concerted activity of a population of neurons. We adapted the Wasserstein-GAN variant to facilitate the generation of unconstrained neural population activity patterns while still benefiting from parameter sharing in the temporal domain. We demonstrate that our proposed GAN, which we termed Spike-GAN, generates spike trains that match accurately the first- and second-order statistics of datasets of tens of neurons and also approximates well their higher-order statistics. We applied Spike-GAN to a real dataset recorded from salamander retina and showed that it performs as well as state-of-the-art approaches based on the maximum entropy and the dichotomized Gaussian frameworks. Importantly, Spike-GAN does not require to specify a priori the statistics to be matched by the model, and so constitutes a more flexible method than these alternative approaches. Finally, we show how to exploit a trained Spike-GAN to construct 'importance maps' to detect the most relevant statistical structures present in a spike train. Spike-GAN provides a powerful, easy-to-use technique for generating realistic spiking neural activity and for describing the most relevant features of the large-scale neural population recordings studied in modern systems neuroscience.\n\n【摘要翻译】合成真实的神经活动模式的能力对于研究神经信息处理至关重要。在这里，我们使用生成对抗性网络（GANs）框架来模拟神经元群体的协同活动。我们调整了Wasserstein GAN变体，以促进无约束神经群体活动模式的生成，同时仍然受益于时域中的参数共享。我们证明，我们提出的GAN，我们称之为Spike GAN，生成的Spike序列与数十个神经元的数据集的一阶和二阶统计数据精确匹配，也很好地近似了它们的高阶统计数据。我们将Spike GAN应用于从蝾螈视网膜记录的真实数据集，并表明它的性能与基于最大熵和二分高斯框架的最先进方法一样好。重要的是，Spike GAN不需要事先指定模型要匹配的统计数据，因此构成了一种比这些替代方法更灵活的方法。最后，我们展示了如何利用经过训练的Spike GAN来构建“重要性图”，以检测Spike序列中存在的最相关的统计结构。Spike GAN提供了一种强大、易于使用的技术，用于生成真实的尖峰神经活动，并用于描述现代系统神经科学中研究的大规模神经群体记录的最相关特征。",

They belong to the broader family of generative methods, which learn to generate realistic data with a probabilistic model by learning distributions from real samples. In the clinical context, GANs have shown enhanced capabilities in capturing spatially complex, nonlinear, and potentially subtle disease effects compared to traditional generative methods. This review critically appraises the existing literature on the applications of GANs in imaging studies of various neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, brain tumors, brain aging, and multiple sclerosis. We provide an intuitive explanation of various GAN methods for each application and further discuss the main challenges, open questions, and promising future directions of leveraging GANs in neuroimaging. We aim to bridge the gap between advanced deep learning methods and neurology research by highlighting how GANs can be leveraged to support clinical decision making and contribute to a better understanding of the structural and functional patterns of brain diseases.\n\n【摘要翻译】生成对抗性网络（GANs）是一种强大的深度学习模型，已成功应用于许多领域。它们属于更广泛的生成方法家族，通过从真实样本中学习分布，学习使用概率模型生成真实数据。在临床背景下，与传统的生成方法相比，GANs在捕捉空间复杂、非线性和潜在的微妙疾病影响方面表现出更强的能力。这篇综述批判性地评价了现有的关于GANs在各种神经疾病的成像研究中的应用的文献，包括阿尔茨海默病、脑肿瘤、脑衰老和多发性硬化症。我们为每种应用提供了各种GAN方法的直观解释，并进一步讨论了在神经成像中利用GAN的主要挑战、悬而未决的问题和有前景的未来方向。我们的目标是通过强调如何利用GANs来支持临床决策，并有助于更好地理解脑疾病的结构和功能模式，弥合先进的深度学习方法与神经病学研究之间的差距。",

		"abstract": "For the recruitment and monitoring of subjects for therapy studies, it is important to predict whether mild cognitive impaired (MCI) subjects will prospectively develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Machine learning (ML) is suitable to improve early AD prediction. The etiology of AD is heterogeneous, which leads to high variability in disease patterns. Further variability originates from multicentric study designs, varying acquisition protocols, and errors in the preprocessing of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The high variability makes the differentiation between signal and noise difficult and may lead to overfitting. This article examines whether an automatic and fair data valuation method based on Shapley values can identify the most informative subjects to improve ML classification.\n\n【摘要翻译】对于招募和监测受试者进行治疗研究，预测轻度认知障碍（MCI）受试者是否会前瞻性地发展为阿尔茨海默病（AD）是很重要的。机器学习（ML）适用于改进早期AD预测。AD的病因是异质性的，这导致了疾病模式的高度变异。进一步的变异源于多中心研究设计、不同的采集协议以及磁共振成像（MRI）扫描预处理中的错误。高可变性使得难以区分信号和噪声，并且可能导致过拟合。本文研究了基于Shapley值的自动和公平的数据评估方法是否可以识别信息量最大的主题，以改进ML分类。",

The hardware combination of anatomy and function has been the true evolution in imaging. PET using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly used for the staging of solid malignancies, including colon, lung, etc., but anatomic information is limited. Integrated PET/CT enables optimal anatomic delineation of PET findings and identification of FDG-negative lesions on computed tomography (CT) images and might improve preoperative staging. However, controversy still exists in relation to the application of PET/CT in clinical practice, mainly because of its high cost. It is evident that apart from additional costs, potential savings also are associated with PET/CT as a result of avoiding additional imaging examinations or invasive procedures and by helping clinicians make the optimum treatment decisions. The authors review the literature on the role of PET/CT in management of various tumors and discuss the medicoeconomic usefulness.\n\n【摘要翻译】PET/CT是一种相对较新的成像技术，其毋庸置疑的优势在临床肿瘤学以及诊断、分期和治疗的各个领域都有价值。解剖学和功能的硬件结合是成像的真正发展。使用18F-氟脱氧葡萄糖（FDG）的PET越来越多地用于实体恶性肿瘤的分期，包括结肠、肺等，但解剖信息有限。集成的PET/CT能够在计算机断层扫描（CT）图像上对PET发现和FDG阴性病变进行最佳解剖描绘，并可能改善术前分期。然而，PET/CT在临床实践中的应用仍存在争议，主要是因为其成本高。很明显，除了额外的成本外，由于避免了额外的成像检查或侵入性手术，并帮助临床医生做出最佳的治疗决策，PET/CT也有潜在的节约。作者回顾了关于PET/CT在各种肿瘤治疗中的作用的文献，并讨论了其医学经济实用性。",

In order to demonstrate the ability of the neocognitron, we also discuss a pattern-recognition system which works with the mechanism of the neocognitron. The system has been implemented on a minicomputer and has been trained to recognize handwritten numerals. The neocognitron is a hierarchical network consisting of many layers of cells, and has variable connections between the cells in adjoining layers. It can acquire the ability to recognize patterns by learning, and can be trained to recognize any set of patterns. After finishing the process of learning, pattern recognition is performed on the basis of similarity in shape between patterns, and is not affected by deformation, nor by changes in size, nor by shifts in the position of the input patterns. In the hierarchical network of the neocognitron, local features of the input pattern are extracted by the cells of a lower stage, and they are gradually integrated into more global features. Finally, each cell of the highest stage integrates all the information of the input pattern, and responds only to one specific pattern. Thus, the response of the cells of the highest stage shows the final result of the pattern-recognition of the network. During this process of extracting and integrating features, errors in the relative position of local features are gradually tolerated. The operation of tolerating positional error a little at a time at each stage, rather than all in one step, plays an important role in endowing the network with an ability to recognize even distorted patterns.\n\n【摘要翻译】作者先前提出了一种用于视觉模式识别的神经网络模型，称为“新认知龙”。在本文中，我们详细讨论了该模型的作用机制。为了证明新认知龙的能力，我们还讨论了一个与新认知龙机制协同工作的模式识别系统。该系统已在小型计算机上实现，并经过训练可以识别手写数字。新认知龙是一个由许多层细胞组成的分层网络，相邻层的细胞之间有可变的连接。它可以通过学习获得识别模式的能力，并可以被训练来识别任何一组模式。在完成学习过程之后，基于图案之间的形状相似性来执行图案识别，并且不受变形、大小变化或输入图案的位置偏移的影响。在新认知龙的层次网络中，输入模式的局部特征由较低阶段的细胞提取，并逐渐整合为更多的全局特征。最后，最高阶段的每个单元集成输入模式的所有信息，并且仅对一个特定模式作出响应。因此，最高阶段细胞的响应显示了网络模式识别的最终结果。在提取和整合特征的过程中，局部特征的相对位置误差逐渐被容忍。在每个阶段一次容忍一点位置误差，而不是一步容忍所有位置误差的操作，在赋予网络识别甚至失真模式的能力方面发挥着重要作用。",

		"abstract": "Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.\n\n【摘要翻译】用反向传播算法训练的多层神经网络构成了成功的基于梯度的学习技术的最佳例子。给定适当的网络架构，基于梯度的学习算法可以用于合成复杂的决策面，该决策面可以在最小的预处理下对高维模式（如手写字符）进行分类。本文综述了应用于手写字符识别的各种方法，并在标准手写数字识别任务中进行了比较。卷积神经网络是专门为处理二维形状的可变性而设计的，其性能优于所有其他技术。现实生活中的文档识别系统由多个模块组成，包括字段提取、分割识别和语言建模。一种新的学习范式，称为图变换网络（GTN），允许使用基于梯度的方法对这种多模块系统进行全局训练，以最小化总体性能度量。介绍了两种在线手写识别系统。实验证明了全局训练的优势和图变换网络的灵活性。还描述了一种用于读取银行支票的图形转换器网络。它使用卷积神经网络字符识别器与全局训练技术相结合，以提供商业和个人支票的记录准确性。它是商业化部署的，每天读取数百万张支票。",

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.\n\n【摘要翻译】更深的神经网络更难训练。我们提出了一个残差学习框架，以简化比以前使用的网络更深的网络训练。我们明确地将层重新表述为参考层输入的学习残差函数，而不是学习未引用的函数。我们提供了全面的经验证据，表明这些残差网络更容易优化，并且可以从显著增加的深度中获得准确性。在ImageNet数据集上，我们评估了深度高达152层的残差网络——比VGG网络深8倍，但仍然具有较低的复杂性。这些残差网络的集合在ImageNet测试集上实现了3.57%的误差。这一结果在ILSVRC 2015分类任务中获得了第一名。我们还对具有100层和1000层的CIFAR-10进行了分析。表示的深度对于许多视觉识别任务来说是至关重要的。完全由于我们非常深入的表示，我们在COCO对象检测数据集上获得了28%的相对改进。深度残差网是我们提交ILSVRC和COCO 2015比赛的基础，在这些比赛中，我们还获得了ImageNet检测、ImageNet定位、COCO检测和COCO分割任务的第一名。",

Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as a classifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, we found that this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process. To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the least squares loss function for the discriminator. We show that minimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson $\\chi^2$ divergence. There are two benefits of LSGANs over regular GANs. First, LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs. Second, LSGANs perform more stable during the learning process. We evaluate LSGANs on five scene datasets and the experimental results show that the images generated by LSGANs are of better quality than the ones generated by regular GANs.

		"abstract": "Medical imaging datasets are inherently high dimensional with large variability and low sample sizes that limit the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) with the ability to synthesize realist images have shown great potential as an alternative to standard data augmentation techniques. Our work focuses on cross-modality synthesis of fluorodeoxyglucose~(FDG) Positron Emission Tomography~(PET) scans from structural Magnetic Resonance~(MR) images using generative models to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, we propose a novel end-to-end, globally and locally aware image-to-image translation GAN (GLA-GAN) with a multi-path architecture that enforces both global structural integrity and fidelity to local details. We further supplement the standard adversarial loss with voxel-level intensity, multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) and region-of-interest (ROI) based loss components that reduce reconstruction error, enforce structural consistency at different scales and perceive variation in regional sensitivity to AD respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our GLA-GAN not only generates synthesized FDG-PET scans with enhanced image quality but also superior clinical utility in improving AD diagnosis compared to state-of-the-art models. Finally, we attempt to interpret some of the internal units of the GAN that are closely related to this specific cross-modality generation task.\n\n【摘要翻译】医学成像数据集本质上是高维的，具有大的可变性和低样本量，这限制了深度学习算法的有效性。最近，具有合成现实主义图像能力的生成对抗性网络（GANs）已显示出作为标准数据增强技术的替代方案的巨大潜力。我们的工作重点是使用生成模型从结构磁共振~（MR）图像中跨模态合成氟脱氧葡萄糖~（FDG）正电子发射断层扫描~（PET）扫描，以促进阿尔茨海默病（AD）的多模态诊断。具体而言，我们提出了一种新的端到端、全局和局部感知的图像到图像翻译GAN（GLA-GAN），该GAN具有多路径架构，可以增强全局结构的完整性和对局部细节的保真度。我们进一步用基于体素水平强度、多尺度结构相似性（MS-SSIM）和感兴趣区域（ROI）的损失分量来补充标准对抗性损失，这些分量分别减少了重建误差，增强了不同尺度上的结构一致性，并感知了区域对AD敏感性的变化。实验结果表明，与最先进的模型相比，我们的GLA-GAN不仅生成具有增强图像质量的合成FDG-PET扫描，而且在改善AD诊断方面具有卓越的临床实用性。最后，我们试图解释与这一特定的跨模态生成任务密切相关的GAN的一些内部单元。",

		"abstract": "We present an interpretable machine learning model for medical diagnosis called sparse high-order interaction model with rejection option (SHIMR). A decision tree explains to a patient the diagnosis with a long rule (i.e., conjunction of many intervals), while SHIMR employs a weighted sum of short rules. Using proteomics data of 151 subjects in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, SHIMR is shown to be as accurate as other non-interpretable methods (Sensitivity, SN = 0.84 ± 0.1, Specificity, SP = 0.69 ± 0.15 and Area Under the Curve, AUC = 0.86 ± 0.09). For clinical usage, SHIMR has a function to abstain from making any diagnosis when it is not confident enough, so that a medical doctor can choose more accurate but invasive and/or more costly pathologies. The incorporation of a rejection option complements SHIMR in designing a multistage cost-effective diagnosis framework. Using a baseline concentration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma proteins from a common cohort of 141 subjects, SHIMR is shown to be effective in designing a patient-specific cost-effective Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Thus, interpretability, reliability and having the potential to design a patient-specific multistage cost-effective diagnosis framework can make SHIMR serve as an indispensable tool in the era of precision medicine that can cater to the demand of both doctors and patients, and reduce the overwhelming financial burden of medical diagnosis.\n\n【摘要翻译】我们提出了一种可解释的医学诊断机器学习模型，称为具有拒绝选项的稀疏高阶交互模型（SHIMR）。决策树用长规则（即多个区间的联合）向患者解释诊断，而SHIMR采用短规则的加权和。使用阿尔茨海默病神经成像倡议（ADNI）数据集中151名受试者的蛋白质组学数据，SHIMR被证明与其他不可解释的方法一样准确（灵敏度，SN=0.84±0.1，特异性，SP=0.69±0.15，曲线下面积，AUC=0.86±0.09）。对于临床应用，SHIMR有一个功能，当它不够自信时，可以避免进行任何诊断，这样医生就可以选择更准确但具有侵入性和/或更昂贵的病理。排斥选择的结合补充了SHIMR在设计多阶段成本效益诊断框架方面的作用。使用来自141名受试者的共同队列的脑脊液（CSF）和血浆蛋白的基线浓度，SHIMR被证明在设计患者特异性成本效益高的阿尔茨海默病（AD）病理学方面是有效的。因此，可解释性、可靠性和设计针对患者的多阶段成本效益诊断框架的潜力，可以使SHIMR成为精准医学时代不可或缺的工具，满足医生和患者的需求，减轻医疗诊断的巨大经济负担。",

		"abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a group of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, Asperger's syndrome (AS) and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). The new diagnostic criteria of ASD focuses on two core domains: social communication impairment and restricted interests/repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of ASD has been steadily increasing over the past two decades, with current estimates reaching up to 1 in 36 children. Hereditary factors, parental history of psychiatric disorders, pre-term births, and fetal exposure to psychotropic drugs or insecticides have all been linked to higher risk of ASD. Several scales such as the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), The Autism Spectrum Disorder–Observation for Children (ASD-OC), The Developmental, Dimensional, and Diagnostic Interview (3di), are available to aid in better assessing the behaviors and symptoms associated with ASD. Nearly 75% of ASD patients suffer from comorbid psychiatric illnesses or conditions, which may include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, Tourette syndrome, and others. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available for ASD. Pharmacological treatments include psychostimulants, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists. These medications provide partial symptomatic relief of core symptoms of ASD or manage the symptoms of comorbid conditions. Non-pharmacological interventions, which show promising evidence in improving social interaction and verbal communication of ASD patients, include music therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and social behavioral therapy. Hormonal therapies with oxytocyin or vasopressin receptor antagonists have also shown some promise in improving core ASD symptoms. The use of vitamins, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements in conjunction with pharmacological and behavioral treatment appear to have some effect in symptomatic improvement in ASD, though additional studies are needed to confirm these benefits. Developing novel disease-modifying therapies may prove to be the ultimate intervention for sustained improvement of symptoms in ASD.\n\n【摘要翻译】自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）是指一组神经发育障碍，包括自闭症、阿斯伯格综合症（AS）和广泛性发育障碍——未另有说明（PDD-NOS）。ASD的新诊断标准侧重于两个核心领域：社会交流障碍和受限兴趣/重复行为。在过去的二十年里，ASD的患病率一直在稳步上升，目前的估计高达36名儿童中的1名。遗传因素、父母精神障碍史、早产和胎儿接触精神药物或杀虫剂都与ASD的高风险有关。儿童自闭症分级量表（CARS）、儿童自闭症谱系障碍观察（ASD-OC）、发育、维度和诊断访谈（3di）等几个量表可用于帮助更好地评估与ASD相关的行为和症状。近75%的ASD患者患有共病精神疾病或病症，其中可能包括注意力缺陷多动障碍（ADHD）、焦虑、双相情感障碍、抑郁症、抽动症等。药物和非药物干预均可用于ASD。药物治疗包括精神刺激剂、非典型抗精神病药物、抗抑郁药和α-2肾上腺素能受体激动剂。这些药物可部分缓解ASD的核心症状或控制共病症状。非药物干预在改善ASD患者的社会互动和语言交流方面显示出有希望的证据，包括音乐疗法、认知行为疗法和社会行为疗法。含催产素或加压素受体拮抗剂的激素疗法也显示出改善ASD核心症状的一些希望。维生素、草药和营养补充剂与药物和行为治疗相结合的使用似乎对ASD的症状改善有一定的效果，尽管需要更多的研究来证实这些益处。开发新的疾病调节疗法可能被证明是持续改善ASD症状的最终干预措施。",

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairment in social communication, restricted, and repetitive patterns of behavior. In recent times, various tools and methods have been developed for the early identification and characterization of ASD features as early as 6 months of age. Thorough and exhaustive research has been done to identify biomarkers in ASD using noninvasive neuroimaging and various molecular methods. By employing advanced assessment tools such as MRI and behavioral assessment methods for accurate characterization of the ASD features and may facilitate pre-emptive interventional and targeted therapy programs. However, the application of advanced quantitative MRI methods is still confined to investigational/laboratory settings, and the clinical implication of these imaging methods in personalized medicine is still in infancy. Longitudinal research studies in neurodevelopmental disorders are the need of the hour for accurate characterization of brain–behavioral changes that could be monitored over a period of time. These findings would be more reliable and consistent with translating into the clinics.
